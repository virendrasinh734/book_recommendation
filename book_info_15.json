In this exquisite book, Steinbach searches for the answer to this question in some of the most beautiful and exciting places in the world: Paris, where she finds a soul mate; Oxford, where she takes a course on the English village; Milan, where she befriends a young woman about to be married.

It is also the story of how the Scrabble game was invented by an unemployed architect during the Great Depression and how it has grown into the hugely successful, challenging, and beloved game it is today. Along the way, Fatsis chronicles his own obsession with the game and his development as a player from novice to expert. More than a book about hardcore Scrabble players, Word Freak is also an examination of notions of brilliance, memory, language, competition, and the mind that celebrates the uncanny creative powers in us all.

Now they must go on a daring undercover mission--as the crew of an Imperial warship. It is Wedge Antilles' boldest creation: a covert-action unit of X-wing fighters, its pilots drawn from the dregs of other units, castoffs and rejects given one last chance. But before the new pilots can complete their training, the squadron's base is attacked by former Imperial admiral Trigit, and Wraith Squadron is forced to swing into action--taking over an Imperial warship and impersonating its crew. The mission: to gain vital intelligence about Trigit's secret weapons, to sabotage the admiral's plans, and to lure him into an Alliance trap. But the high-stakes gamble pits Wraith Squadron's ragtag renegades against the Empire's most brilliant master of guile and deception. Are they up to the challenge?

But Jake soon learned that appearances can be deceiving, and that even small towns have their share of dark secrets \u2014 including murder. Wreck The Halls People hardly ever lock their doors in Eastport. So when Jake and her best pal, Ellie, arrive at Faye Anne Carmody\u2019s kitchen door, they knock and walk right in. But though Christmas is just two weeks away, what they find is far from festive: a dazed Faye Anne covered with blood, and her no-good husband \u2014 the town butcher, Merle \u2014 nowhere in sight. Nowhere, that is, until Jake discovers his body \u2014 tidily wrapped in his own butcher paper.... It doesn\u2019t take long for news of the murder to race through the small town, and just about everyone has a theory about the grisly crime that has robbed Eastport of its least-liked citizen. But while police chief Bob Arnold considers it an open-and-shut case, Jake and Ellie aren\u2019t convinced of Faye Anne\u2019s guilt. Jake has enough going on in her life without trying to investigate a murder. After all, she\u2019s just married her longtime love, Wade, and the pair plan to spend the winter rehabilitating the paint-encrusted windows in Jake\u2019s old house. But Jake has to admit that there are a lot of details that don\u2019t add up: for example, Faye Anne\u2019s complaint that she was being stalked, and blood-splattered evidence at the crime scene that just doesn\u2019t make sense. Then there is the diary that Faye Anne\u2019s secret, sometime boyfriend claims is hidden somewhere in her house. Could Faye Anne\u2019s own journal be the key to unlocking an even more fiendish murder plot, or is her double-crossing lover trying to frame her? When yet another Eastport citizen turns up dead, Jake realizes the murderer\u2019s trail began long before the night Merle Carmody died. But what keeps eluding her and Ellie is the motive behind the mystery. The truth is so close, they can almost taste it \u2014 but can they stop the shrewd killer before he chisels another victim\u2019s name onto a tombstone?",

Nominated as part of a National Magazine Award, broadcast on National Public Radio, performed at venues across the country, the story brought the author widespread recognition. Now, in his first book, Adam Haslett gives us nine richly varied stories, each suffused with intense emotion and written in a lyric prose alternatively lush and spare. \"You Are Not a Stranger Here carries its readers into the hearts and minds of people facing life's most profound dilemmas. We meet an aging inventor still burning with ideas as he makes a final visit to his gay son. A psychiatrist's encounter with a reluctant patient reveals a young doctor's own needs and fears. An orphaned boy finds solace in a classmate's violence. The return of an old lover disturbs the peace between a brother and sister who have lived together for decades. In settings that range from New England to Great Britain, from Los Angeles to the American West, the stories in this book treat what Faulkner called the old verities and truths of the heart: love and honor, pity and pride, compassion and sacrifice. They do so with heartbreaking precision and an often generous humor, drawing us past the surface of characters' lives into the moments of decision and recognition that shape them irrevocably. Together these stories constitute a significant achievement by a powerful new writer.",

USA Today praised her novel, Patty Jane's House of Curl, as \"fun and funny, spiked with tragedy and sad times.\" Now, in Your Oasis on Flame Lake, she continues to create real, resilient people we come to know and love. All you have to do is see a fiery sunset reflecting on the water to figure out how Flame Lake got its name. The small Minnesota town onshore is home to a close-knit group of old friends who discover their comfortable lives taking some unforeseen turns. Best friends fast approaching forty, Devera and BiDi (short for Beverly Diane) were recently voted \"Least Changed\" at their twentieth high school reunion. Once overjoyed, Devera now finds the label insulting. Oh, she loves her husband and still believes being a wife and mother is the main entree on life's plate. She just longs for the more exotic side dishes. BiDi is adored by her second husband Sergio but her only passions are her perfect household and her perfect body. These priorities sadden her daughter, Francine, a stocky fourteen-year-old and the only girl on the high school hockey team. Francine feels closer to her stepdad, a spirited, supportive soul who loves her right back. BiDi can't figure it out. Nor can she pinpoint the reason why her own sex drive is stuck in neutral, despite a thin and gorgeous chassis. Then there's Devera's husband, Dick Lindstrom, an ace car and appliance salesman with cabaret in his heart. He dreams of opening a night club in his basement. Nothing fancy. Just a BYOB joint to hang out in, sing, dance, tell jokes, and be yourself. The name? Your Oasis at Flame Lake. Andit arrives not a moment too soon. For a violent, unexpected crisis will throw both families into chaos--and force them to take stock of their lives. A wonderful, heartfelt novel of feeling, loving, and forgiving, Your Oasis at Flame Lake proves that Lorna Landvik is a writer who has arrived.",

        "description": "You know the feeling -- deja vu, already knowing what someone will say before they speak, a gut instinct that overrides logic, hearing from a distant friend you'd only just thought of that day. It happens to everyone, but few of us acknowledge these occurrences as manifestations of our own psychic ability. Now, bestselling author Belleruth Naparstek reclaims the world of psychic phenomena from its sideshow trappings, examining scientific data and showing each of us how to tap our own latent powers of awareness and perception. Naparstek, one of the country's leading teachers and speakers on developing the powers of the mind and heart, has trained thousands of individuals in using guided imagery techniques for psychic development and improved health and healing. Her powerful techniques have reached a wide audience--from \"the intuitively gifted to those whose third eye seemed virtually cemented shut.\" With Your Sixth Sense, Naparstek shares her proven methods in a guide that is both practical and wonderfully informative. Based on her own experience, her work with clients, and interviews with more than forty highly skilled \"intuitives,\" or psychics, Your Sixth Sense provides both a thorough exploration of the nature of psychic ability--how and why it works--and a step-by-step guide filled with specific suggestions and exercises carefully designed to help you foster, track, and illuminate your own rich output of psychic experience. In an engaging, conversational style, Naparstek tackles the subject so often shunted to the realm of cut-rate fortune tellers, psychic hotlines, and television exposes on the paranormal, offering a thoroughly accessible scientific explanation of the physics of ESP, a detailed description of what happens in the mind just before and during an intuitive \"pop,\" and much more. Your Sixth Sense is the only guide you'll need for recognizing, utilizing, and expanding the dormant powers of your own mind. This is a book about how to recognize, cultivate, and direct the natural gift that we all are born with: our sixth sense. When all is said and done, our ability to know things in a way that leaps over \"normal\" cognition and perception and just shows up as a sudden intuition or a pop of psychic awareness is an altogether logical, natural, and predictable human skill. This book shows you how the sixth sense is simply standard-issue equipment, along with our eyes, ears, tongues, noses and skin. It is only as magical and as ordinary as they are--which is plenty magical enough--but no more and no less. --from the Preface \" I loved this book. Reading it was an experience of remembering my own intuition and learning to trust it even more. Belleruth's insights are practical, grounded, validating, and helpful. This is a well-researched, thoughtful how-to-book, filled with stories and exercises, and accessible at any number of levels. There is truly something here for everyone.\" --Christiane Northrup, M.D., author of Women's Bodies, Women's Wisdom \"Belleruth Naparstek's penetrating study of intuitives has transformed this brilliant classic, which unites the logic of the mind with the wisdom of the heart. Her wit, intellect, and compassion not only illuminate the science of the sixth sense but also provide a sound, practical framework for the development ;of psychic potential. Grounded in the cultivation of empathy, the exercises in this book will open your heart and expand your sense of intimate connectedness with this remarkable universe.\" --Joan Borysenko, Ph.D., author of Minding the Body, Mending the Mind and A Woman's Book of Life \"I do not know of any other book that combines the wisdom of a psychotherapist, the knowledge of a scholar, the skill of a master hypnotist, the sensitivity of a psychic intuitive, and the memories of a remarkable collection of gifted practitioners. This book is a treasure!\" --Jeffrey Mishlove, Ph.D., president of Intuition Network and author of Roots of Consciousness",

Few books invite comparison with Moby Dick, but since Mr. Pirsig's book appeared nearly 20 years ago, critics have found the analogy unavoidable. Like Ishmael's voyage aboard the Pequot, Robert Pirsig's journey is both an exciting physical excursion and, more important, an intriguing exploration of the soul.",

Now, it's your turn. Jump!\" Zest. Gusto. Curiosity. These are the qualities every writer must have, as well as a spirit of adventure. In this exuberant book, the incomparable Ray Bradbury shares the wisdom, experience, and excitement of a lifetime of writing. Here are practical tips on the art of writing from a master of the craft-everything from finding original ideas to developing your own voice and style-as well as the inside story of Bradbury's own remarkable career as a prolific author of novels, stories, poems, films, and plays.Zen In The Art Of Writingis more than just a how-to manual for the would-be writer: it is a celebration of the act of writing itself that will delight, impassion, and inspire the writer in you. In it, Bradbury encourages us to follow the unique path of our instincts and enthusiasms to the place where our inner genius dwells, and he shows that success as a writer depends on how well you know one subject: your own life.",

        "description": "In a voice both innocent and wise, touchingly reminiscent of Anne Frank's, Zlata Filipovic's diary has awoken the conscience of the world. Now thirteen years old, Zlata began her diary just before her eleventh birthday, when there was peace in Sarajevo and her life was that of a bright, intelligent, carefree young girl. Her early entries describe her friends, her new skis, her family, her grades at school, her interest in joining the Madonna Fan Club. And then, on television, she sees the bombs falling on Dubrovnik. Though repelled by the sight, Zlata cannot conceive of the same thing happening in Sarajevo. When it does, the whole tone of her diary changes. Early on, she starts an entry to \"Dear Mimmy\" (named after her dead goldfish): \"SLAUGHTERHOUSE! MASSACRE! HORROR! CRIMES! BLOOD! SCREAMS! DESPAIR!\" We see the world of a child increasingly circumscribed by the violence outside. Zlata is confined to her family's apartment, spending the nights, as the shells rain down mercilessly, in a neighbor's cellar. And the danger outside steadily invades her life. No more school. Living without water and electricity. Food in short supply. The onslaught destroys the pieces she loves, kills or injures her friends, visibly ages her parents. In one entry Zlata cries out, \"War has nothing to do with humanity. War is something inhuman\". In another, she thinks about killing herself. Yet, with indomitable courage and a clarity of mind well beyond her years, Zlata preserves what she can of her former existence, continuing to study piano, to find books to read, to celebrate special occasions - recording it all in the pages of this extraordinary diary.",

        "description": "Zoya's Story is a young woman's searing account of her clandestine war of resistance against the Taliban and religious fanaticism at the risk of her own life. An epic tale of fear and suffering, courage and hope, Zoya's Story is a powerful testament to the ongoing battle to claim human rights for the women of Afghanistan. Though she is only twenty-three, Zoya has witnessed and endured more tragedy and terror than most people do in a lifetime. Zoya grew up during the wars that ravaged Afghanistan and was robbed of her mother and father when they were murdered by Muslim fundamentalists. Devastated by so much death and destruction, she fled Kabul with her grandmother and started a new life in exile in Pakistan. She joined the Revolutionary Association of the Women of Afghanistan, which challenged the crushing edicts of the Taliban government, and she made dangerous journeys back to her homeland to help the women oppressed by a system that forced them to wear the stifling burqa, condoned public stoning or whipping if they ventured out without a male chaperon, and forbade them from working. Zoya is our guide, our witness to the horrors perpetrated by the Taliban and the Mujahideen \"holy warriors\" who had defeated the Russian occupiers. She helped to secretly film a public cutting of hands in a Kabul stadium and to organize covert literacy classes, as schooling-branded a \"gateway to Hell\" -- was forbidden to girls. At an Afghan refugee camp she heard tales of heartrending suffering and worked to provide a future for families who had lost everything. The spotlight focused on Afghanistan after the New York and Washington terrorist attacks highlights the conditions of repression and fear in which Afghan women live and makes Zoya's Story utterly compelling. This is a memoir that speaks louder than the images of devastation and outrage; it is a moving message of optimism as Zoya struggles to bring the plight of Afghan women to the world's attention.",
