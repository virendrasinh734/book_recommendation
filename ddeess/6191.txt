Wanted! A gentleman of means, neither young nor decrepit. Looks irrelevant. Generous to a fault. Criminal record not a problem. Witty, mature, decisive widow has recently relocated to New York City in order to be very, very close to her grown children (who prefer managing their own lives, thank you very much). Their lifelong gratitude and relief (plus their lovely mother -- as long as you move out of state) will be your REWARD. Not offer of any kind will be rufused.
