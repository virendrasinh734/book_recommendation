Barbara Lavette was raised amid the opulence of Nob Hill. She renounced her aristocratic heritage to marry a rebel, a man scorned by society. But her defiant victory would be shattered by tragedy. Everything she cherished would be menaced by hysteria in a nation gripped by fear. The Lavettes are a special breed and a powerful and passionate clan. Swept up in the McCarthy witchhunts, struggling to help a newborn Israel survive, they would be caught up in a turbulent saga of war, money, and politics. Some would seek fame and power, others would confront danger and betrayal. All would fulfill their magnificent destinies as their lives became a stunning portrait of their times.--From cover [p. 4].
