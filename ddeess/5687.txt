Cage Hendren was his twin Hal's opposite in every way. Hal was dedicated to a worthy cause; Cage was the black sheep of the family. Hal graciously allowed his fiancee, Jenny, to help him with his work; Cage just loved her with all his heart. When Hal died, Jenny was carrying what she thought was his child. Now Cage had to trust that the memory of his tender passion--rather than his deception--would be enough to show her she'd been with the wrong brother all along.
