A powerful novel of a man and a woman from different worlds whose passion binds them together even as it tears them apart--from the bestselling author of When Venus Fell and A Place to Call Home There had always been MacKenzies and Colebrooks at Blue Willow, their histories entangled like the graceful branches of the rare willow trees that thrived there. Artemas Colebrook and Lily MacKenzie shared more than that history, their souls bound to each other and to the land the day the boy held tiny Lily minutes after her birth. But the tragedy that has brought Lily back to the small farm where she spent her childhood has also made Artemas's brothers and sisters her bitter enemies. Torn between family loyalties and their shared sense of destiny, Artemas and Lily must come to terms with a childhood devotion that has turned to bittersweet desire, a passion that could destroy all they have struggled for--even Blue Willow itself. Praise for Blue Willow "Smith knows how to generate genuine emotion."--Publishers Weekly "Smith [is] a remarkably talented prolific storyteller who creates unforgettable characters."--Booklist "A moving journey into the heart and soul of enduring love."--Julie Garwood
