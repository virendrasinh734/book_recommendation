A small pottery shop and a gigantic business district is the setting for a world that is rapidly heading towards extinction, another which grows and multiplies within a mirrored maze where there appear to be no boundaries nor limits to false illusions. La caverna is the story of a family of potters who realize that their craft is no longer appreciated in such a fast-paced, ever-changing society. "This remarkably generous and eloquent novel is another landmark work from an 80-year-old literary giant."--Publishers Weekly.
