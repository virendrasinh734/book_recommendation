In this delightfully wicked collection, four bestselling authors--Brenda Joyce, Rexanne Becnel, Jill Jones, and Barbara Dawson Smith--depict weddings at their most scandalous--and tying the knot has never been so outrageous. Steamy, sensuous, and more delicious than a piece of wedding cake, "Scandalous Weddings" is the romantic event of the season.
