Bestselling author Andrea Kane delivers an electrifying novel of suspense and seduction as one woman is swept up in a maelstrom of dangerous secrets, ruthless ambition, and unexpected passion. When Dylan Newport, a high-powered attorney for the company that manufactures C'est Moi -- the revolutionary fragrance that makes women irresistible to men -- finds his boss, Carson Brooks, shot and nearly dead, he sets out to fulfill what may be the billionaire CEO's last wish: to find out whether a business deal he made twenty-eight years ago to start his company also resulted in his fathering a child. Dylan's search leads him to Sabrina Radcliffe, a brilliant management consultant who is shocked to learn her father's identity. Yet when she meets Carson face-to-face, there's an instant connection. His appointing her interim CEO is the opportunity of a lifetime, until she becomes the target of his enemies. As suspects -- and victims -- begin to pile up, Sabrina turns to Dylan and finds that their own perfect chemistry is kindling into soul-deep desire. But first they must confront an elusive adversary intent on destroying everything -- and everyone -- they cherish.
