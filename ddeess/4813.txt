Four young girls are abducted by the same man. All that each of them can remember is a strange dream of black velvet walls, flowers and soft music. Not much of a lead for D.A. Sarah Spooner to investigate, but the case of the Velvet Viper will soon become terrifyingly personal--for Sarah has a daughter of her own. Copyright Â© Libri GmbH. All rights reserved.
