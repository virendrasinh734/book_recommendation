Chicken Soup for the Pet Lover's Soul spoke directly to the hearts of all readers whose lives have ever been changed by the love of a pet. Now the coauthors bring readers this volume, honoring the unique and enduring love that people share with their cats and dogs. Like its predecessor, this book is a joyous and inspiring collection--sometimes poignant, sometimes amusing, always filled with the special and incredibly unconditional love only cats and dogs can give. The stories in this collection celebrate those lovable furry, four-legged creatures that bring out the best in all of us, inspiring us to be happier, kinder, more understanding and more loving. Readers will discover that many of humanity's greatest heroes, healers and teachers are not humans at all, but those amazing cats and dogs that brighten all our lives.
