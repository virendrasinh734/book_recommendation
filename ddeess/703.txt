There's trouble brewing in sunny Hawaii. It's been a bad month for free-spirited journalist Star Hollie. Not only does he owe money to Mako, a feared loan shark, but he also runs a personal ad with dangerous and unanticipated results. When one of the beautiful and lonely women who answers his ad turns up dead on the beach, Star is pulled into a conspiracy that could keep Hollywood in B movies for years. Bringing him face to face with an ex-military sadist, two dim-witted Appalachian twins, and a financier with dreams of turning an earthly paradise into the ultimate golf resort. Star finds himself not attracting beautiful women, but attracting a whole monsoon of trouble that keeps this unlikely slooth dodging bullets, lava, and legends.
