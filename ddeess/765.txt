Does your mother call you in a panic when she hears a storm warning for your area? Does she act as though it's her duty to alert you to every health story she hears on the news? Have you ever been briefly out of contact with your mother only to find she has phoned friends, neighbours and even the hospital looking for you! This hilarious new book from AMY BORKOWSKY'S mother includes messages plus the stories behind them; additional messages never before released; emails in which Amy's fans share the most extreme calls from their own mothers; and tips on dealing with a mother who uses the phone cord as an umbilical cord. Thanks to AMY'S ANSWERING MACHINE, children of all ages can take comfort in knowing they don't suffer alone...and mothers can show their kids that, compared to Amy's mum, they're not that bad.
