Food writer Carolyn gets to challenge her taste-testing skills once again-this time, in Barcelona. Her first feast is for the eyes - at a modern art museum where her friend Roberta is the resident scholar. There, she catches a performance art piece about death, planted a little too firmly in reality. One of the actors is not acting - she's dead... as well as a dead-ringer for Roberta. And now, Carolyn is in the middle of a new investigation into a very unsavoury crime.
