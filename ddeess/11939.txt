"Tell me a story no one has heard before", Eva Luna's lover asks her, and Eva Luna obliges with an enchanting medley that evokes all the pathos, love, joy, and misery of life in Latin America. Set from the humid Caribbean to the Antarctic tip of Argentina, Allende's stories capture the richness of the Latin American experience and range in theme from the extinction of Amazon tribes to the modern theory that love can conquer cancer. In The Stories of Eva Luna Allende employs magical realism to integrate dreamlike elements into the landscape of her Latin American characters. The result, a provocative collection showcasing her haunting mythic voice and fantastic imagery, prompted the San Francisco Chronicle to say, "Allende again shows her brilliance as a storyteller".
