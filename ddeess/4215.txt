"With Grass for His Pillow, Book Two of the Otori trilogy, we return to the medieval Japan of Hearn's imagination - a land of harsh beauty and deceptive appearances." "In a complex social hierarchy, amid dissembling clans and fractured allegiances, there is no place for passionate young love. The orphan Takeo, who has been taught the ways of the warrior class by Lord Otori Shigeru, has now been claimed by the Tribe; held by them against his will, he is condemned to work as an assassin an enforced occupation that his father sacrificed his own life to escape. Meanwhile, Takeo's beloved Shirakawa Kaede, heir to the Maruyama and alone in the world, must find a way to unify the domain she has inherited, as she fights off the advances of would-be suitors and hopes against fading hope that Takeo will return to her." "Both Takeo and Kaede must draw upon their unusual talents and hidden strengths, and make their way in this tale of longing, ambition, and intrigue. A mythical adventure of self discovery, Grass for His Pillow acutely probes the conflicts between duty and passion, violence, and compassion, deception and truth."--BOOK JACKET.
