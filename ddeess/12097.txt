A New York Times Bestseller. From the bestselling author of The Thorn Birds comes a family saga replete with tragedy, pathos, history and passion. At its center are Alexander, who fled poverty in Scotland to make his fortune in the American and Australian gold fields; his wife Elizabeth, a sixteen-year-old cousin sent from Scotland; and his mistress, Ruby, who is unknown to Elizabeth and is a partner in Alexander's rapidly growing company.
