Frank Galvin, a smart Irishman from the tough side of town, is the star litigator at a blue-chip Boston law firm. But the irresistible lure of a beautiful woman with a devastating secret threatens his hard-won acceptance by "the establishment." Suddenly, Frank finds himself on the wrong side of a ferocious legal war-hired to destroy the people he he trusts, loyal to those he doesn't. He's facing the biggest choice of his career-and the ultimate battle between duty and honor. Caught in the crossfire of sexual temptation and murder, he'll call on the same unorthodox methods that made things sizzle in The Verdict. But this time, Galvin's got a lot more at stake, because winning the case could mean losing everything.
