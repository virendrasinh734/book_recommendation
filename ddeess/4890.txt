Blending the fictional with the factual, this highly praised novel ranges from the warm shores of seventeenth-century Barbados to the harsh realities of the slave trade, and the cold customs of Puritanical New England. It tells the story of Tituba, the only Black victim of the Salem witch trials and in doing so recalls a life of extraordinary experiences and mystical powers. Foreword by Angela Davis. Winner of France's prestigious Grand Prix Literaire de la Femme.
