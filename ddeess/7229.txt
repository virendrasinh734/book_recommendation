New York Times bestselling author Catherine Anderson takes readers to a quaint wilderness town, where a man and a woman find a second chance at life—and love… Determined to give her son Jeremy the childhood he deserves, Chloe Evans has left a tough past behind and is starting fresh in the charming resort town of Jack Pine, Oregon. But protecting Jeremy becomes a dicey proposition when he seeks out the most dangerous man in town to heal his sick puppy. Chloe has been warned to stay away from Ben Longtree. But there’s something about the gentle, untamed loner that intrigues her… Long ago, Ben accepted his role as town outcast. Rumored to have once killed a man, he lives in splendid isolation with his forgetful mother, secretly employing his skills as a veterinarian to heal the wounded animals that mysteriously come to him. Now, Chloe’s sunny warmth and brave tenacity arouse desires he has long denied. And although Ben is notorious for his healing touch, it is Chloe’s hands—and heart—that have the power to save his battered soul.
