2 cassettes / 3 hours Read by Judy Kaye Kinsey Millhone, the irreverent, wise-cracking P.I. with a style reminiscent of Philip Marlowe, is back in a high-stakes adventure. His name was Parnell Perkins and until shortly after midnight, he'd been a claims adjuster for California Fidelity. Then someone had come along and ended his career . . . permanently. To the cops, his death looked like a robber gone sour; to Kinsey Millhone, it looked strangely suspicious. Particularly when Bibianna Diaz's name surfaced in one of Perkins' files. It seems she had pulled an insurance scam, with California Fidelity as her mark. Now, Kinsey was after her. But so, too, was her spurned suitor, Raymond Maldonado. he had a rap sheet as long as his arm and an inability to take no for an answer. Could Kinsey get to Bibianna first and solve the mystery of Perkins' murder? Or would she find that once you crossed Raymond Maldonado, you didn't live to tell the tape?
