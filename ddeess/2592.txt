L.A. detective Peter Decker and his Jewish bride, Rina Lazarus, are spending their honeymoon in the unlikely locale of Brooklyn, celebrating the Jewish High Holidays. But the festivities are shattered when Noam, an Orthodox teenager, runs away from his family and his cloistered community. Finding runaways is Decker's specialty. But it's tough getting anyone to open up about a missing kid nobody likes, especially in a close-knit Orthodox society where Decker is clearly an outsider. Then he discovers a line to the outside world that could be the hook he needs to reel in the kid and his companion--a dangerous psychopath with nothing to lose. . . .
