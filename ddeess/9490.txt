"Following the unprecedented response to her #1 New York Times bestseller Embraced By The Light, Betty J. Eadie has shared her message with millions of readers eager to enrich their lives with the powerful faith, hope, and love she has so memorably described. Now, she takes us to new levels of spiritual discovery, addressing many of the concerns that affect us most by showing how she has transformed her own life with the mind-opening vision that captivated the world. The Awakening Heart expands on the invaluable knowledge and insights she has received, giving us more revelations made known to her during her near-death experience and in subsequent visions and visitations, and showing us how the healing power of positive sacred energy can affect and uplift every aspect of our daily lives. Drawing on Betty's own sometimes difficult spiritual awakening following her return to this life, as well as the ennobling experiences shared by some of the people she has met on her journeys, The Awakening Heart radiates the strength of unconditional love, helping each one of us to seek and find the light of God within us."--BOOK JACKET.Title Summary field provided by Blackwell North America, Inc.
