He could see everyone's future but his own. . . .Victor Mackenzie has always considered his clairvoyance a gift, even though it does make his life difficult at times. A casual encounter with a stranger leaves his head spinning with the most private details of another person's life. A ghost named Murray pays regular visits, relaying career advice and requests for grandchildren from Victor's dead mother. And women . . . well, women are wary, to put it mildly, of commitment to a man who can see inside their souls. So when he finds himself completely infatuated with a client who has come for a reading, he knows that love is a long shot. But he also knows that happiness with a new man is in the tarot cards for her. And while he doesn't dare read his own palm, Victor sees himself as just the guy she has in mind. . . .
