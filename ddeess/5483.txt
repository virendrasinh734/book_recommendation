James Lowder brings forth a tale of horror & adventure in this, the second novel in the RAVENLOFT fantasy horror setting. By pitting Lord Soth, a strong evil character from the DRAGONLANCE saga, against the vampire lord of a dark domain, Lowder creates a strong tension that receives a resolution befitting the characters' nature. The death knight, Lord Soth is trapped in a netherworld with which he must come to terms. But as he searches for a way out, his obsessions become his doom. Each story in the RAVENLOFT series is complete in itself. KNIGHT OF THE BLACK ROSE is sure to appeal to the Gothic horror aficionado. Lowder also wrote CRUSADE, book three of the Empires Trilogy, set in the FORGOTTEN REALMS world.
