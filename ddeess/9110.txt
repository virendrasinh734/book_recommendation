One Dead. One Missing. One Man Who can't Look Away... In Los Angeles Lt. Peter Decker gets a frantic phone call from his family. A distant relative has been found naked and murdered in a seedy Manhattan hotel room and the man's niece, the last person who may have seen the victim alive, has disappeared. Crazed with worry, the girl's parents plead for Decker's help and soon he's racing across the continent to a city he hasn't seen in ten years. With few leads and less time, he plunges into New York's underbelly, a world where vile deeds, unregenerate evil, and sinister secrets pit brother against brother. And where Decker will question the very essence of his faith and fight for everything and everyone he holds dear-including his wife, Rina.
