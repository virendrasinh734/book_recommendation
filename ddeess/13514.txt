Critics call Perri O’Shaughnessy’s legal thrillers “terrific...will keep you turning the pages into the night” (USA Today) and “gripping” (San Francisco Chronicle Book Review). Now the New York Times bestselling author ratchets up the suspense yet again...with an electrifying novel that plunges Lake Tahoe attorney Nina Reilly into a shadowy world of high-stakes money and cold-blooded murder. . . . An attorney and single mother, Nina Reilly sees other people’s ups and downs as clearly as she sees her own. But she’s never seen anything like the fierce, terrified young woman who comes to her in the middle of the night, trailing a computer geek who was a stranger a few hours before. Their problem: they just won seven million dollars at the slot machines. Within hours, her client’s good fortune has plunged Nina into a battle that will be waged in court and on the streets. The young woman’s past—and the mysterious death of her husband in Hawaii—has triggered a powerful man’s crusade of revenge. But a moment of chance and enough money to save two troubled lives has done something worse: it’s brought a killer into their midst. . .
