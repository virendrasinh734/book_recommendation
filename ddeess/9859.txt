* After eating a full breakfast, are you hungrier before it's time for lunch, than you would be if you only had time for a cup of coffee? * Do you have a hard time stopping once you start to eat bread, pasta, or sweets? * Do you have a tendency to gain weight easily, or if you lose weight, to gain it back again? If you answered yes to one or more of these questions, you may not be experiencing a lack of willpower but rather a physical addiction to carbohydrates--a compelling or recurring craving for starches, snack foods, or sweets.
