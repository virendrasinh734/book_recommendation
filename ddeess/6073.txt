Another hit from the New York Times bestselling author of Bury Me Deep. Mary Carlson had wanted to kill more than the two people she blew away with a shotgun at the party. And when her best friend Angela asks her why, Mary responds, "Because they're no longer human". At first Angela thinks she's crazy. But soon she discovers a horror so unimaginable, she wonders if she should have let Mary go on killing.
