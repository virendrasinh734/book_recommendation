In 1988 43-year-old Jeff Winston died of a heart attack. But then he awoke, and it was 1963; Jeff was 18 all over again, his memory of the next two decades intact. This time around Jeff would gain all the power and wealth he never had before. This time around he'd know how to do it right . . . until next time. Copyright Â© Libri GmbH. All rights reserved.
