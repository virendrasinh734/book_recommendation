In Julie Ortolon's novel of small towns and big dreams, a devastatingly handsome anchorman thinks he has seen it all--until he rediscovers the girl next door. Owner of the face that launched a thousand newscasts, drop-dead-gorgeous TV anchor Brent Michaels returns to his Texas hometown for a good cause: playing the bachelor in a dating game fund-raiser. He couldn't refuse the request of his old friend Laura Beth Morgan. But Laura's no longer the shy wallflower that he remembers. When he gets a good look at the girl he loved and lost, Brent realizes he can't refuse her anything. Laura yearns to break free, just as Brent did. He has come so far from the boy who grew up on the wrong side of the tracks, the childhood friend who kissed her once and ran away. But even as he warns her that he's incapable of love, Brent isn't running now. After all these years, Laura has blossomed into a beautiful woman--and an irresistible challenge for a man who's used to getting everything he desires.
