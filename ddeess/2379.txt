Hoping to meet that special someone? Wear a sprig of maidenhair fern. Having problems with your cash flow? Burn cloves as incense to attract riches. Want to enhance your psychic abilities? Brew up some dandelion root tea. In days gone by our ancestors lived in harmony with the earth. They knew which plants could heal and which ones could kill. They also knew that plants harbored magical powers, forces that could be harnessed and directed to fulfill a need -- anything from protecting a house to finding true love. Magical herbalism is the use of these powers to create positive changes. This revised and updated fifteenth anniversary edition contains the folklore and magical properties of over 400 herbs. Far from concentrating on esoteric, unobtainable plants, many of those mentioned within are old friends. The magical properties of onions, cashews, apples, rice, lettuce -- as well as dill, basil, fennel, garlic, and parsley are described. Extensive tables, a cross-reference of folk names, glossary, and annotated bibliography make this a comprehensive and valuable guide to the practice of magical herbalism. Book jacket.
