New York Times bestselling author Julie Garwood weaves a bold, breathless tale of a rebellious woman, a fierce chieftain, and the searing love that sealed their destiny. By edict of the King, Scottish laird Alec Kincaid must take an English bride. His choice was Jamie, a fiesty, violet-eyed beauty--who vowed never to surrender to the highlander.
