"A GOLDEN CONJUNCTION OF HEAVEN AND EARTH...Reminding us that there are angels in every religion." --The Washington Post When Sophy Burnham wrote A BOOK OF ANGELS, she inspired a phenomenon. An instant bestseller when it was originally published, this beautiful volume tells not only the extraordinary true stories of present-day encounters with angels, but also traces the understanding and study of angels throughout history and in different cultures. What do angels look like? Whom do they choose to visit? Why do they appear more often to children than to adults? An eloquent report from the place where earth and heaven meet, A BOOK OF ANGELS is a quest into mysteries and a song of praise to life. "A BOOK OF ANGELS is a kind of timeless tour, led by ordinary people who've met angels, and extraordinary writers who've set down ageless thoughts: Milton, Dante, Goethe, Shakespeare, Blake, Rilke, Dostoevsky, Swedenborg, and Poe, along with passages from the Bible and Koran." --Los Angeles Times "Like all good books, it exceeds the subject and illuminates the tough, tiring, and sometimes miraculous business of living, where angels sometimes help out....The visible and invisible dance with each other continually and as far as angels are concerned, now you see them, now you don't. A BOOK OF ANGELS gives us a lovely, sustained glimpse." --Chicago Tribune
