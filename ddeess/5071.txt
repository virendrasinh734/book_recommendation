He must rescue his father, eminent professor Dr. Henry Jones, from the Nazis’ clutches to keep them from discovering secrets only Dr. Jones possesses—secrets that could reveal the location of the Holy Grail. The perilous race is on to save his father and recover the most extraordinary relic of all time—and to prevent the Nazis and Dr. Jones’s devious rivals from finding it first.
