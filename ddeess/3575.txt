Nell Dysart's in trouble.Weighed down by an inexplicable divorce and a loss of appetite for everything, Nell is sleepwalking through life until her best friend finagles a job for her with a shabby little detective agency that has lots of potential and a boss who looks easy to manage.Gabe McKenna isn't doing too well, either. His detective agency is wasting time on a blackmail case, his partner has decided he hates watching cheating spouses for money, and his ex-wife has just dumped him . . . again. The only thing that1s going his way is that his new secretary looks efficient, boring, and biddable.But looks can be deceiving, and soon Nell and Gabe are squaring off over embezzlement, business cards, vandalism, dog-napping, blackmail, Chinese food, unprofessional sex, and really ugly office furniture, all of which turn out to be the least of their problems. Because shortly after that, somebody starts killing people. And shortly after that, they start falling in love.Jennifer Crusie's Fast Women will keep you guessing, laughing, rooting for Nell and Gabe (and hoping that Gabe's cousin Riley wins their bet!).AUTHORBIO: Jennifer Crusie is the USA Today and New York Times Bestselling author of Tell Me Lies, Crazy for You, and Welcome to Temptation.She teaches writing at Ohio State University and lives in Columbus, Ohio.
