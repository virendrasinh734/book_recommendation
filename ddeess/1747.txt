Dirk Pitt discovers a shocking scheme--a covert group of U.S. industrialists has put a colony on the moon. Threatened in space, the Russians are about to strike a savage blow in Cuba--and only Dirk Pitt can stop them. From a Cuban torture chamber to the cold ocean depths, Pitt is racing to defuse an international conspiracy that threatens to shatter the earth.
