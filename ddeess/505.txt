Elizabeth Cameron's uncle--guardian of her estate--forces the scandal-ridden young woman to choose from three unlikely suitors. But the one she fancies sees her as a flirt; and she fears he is a fortune hunter. From London's salons to Scotland's highlands, Almost Heaven weaves a heart-capturing spell of romance.
