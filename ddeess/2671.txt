The Dresden Files have taken the genre of paranormal mystery to a new level of action, excitement, and hard-hitting magical muscle. Now, in Death Masks, Jim Butcher’s smart-guy private eye may have taken on more than he can handle... Harry Dresden, Chicago’s only practicing professional wizard, should be happy that business is pretty good for a change. But he also knows that whenever things are going good, the only way left for them to go is bad. Way bad. Such as: • A duel with the lethal champion of the Red Court, who must kill Harry to end the war between vampires and wizards... • Professional hit men using Harry for target practice... • The missing Shroud of Turin—and the possible involvement of Chicago's most feared mob boss... • A handless and headless corpse the Chicago police need identified... Not to mention the return of Harry’s ex-girlfriend Susan, who’s still struggling with her semi-vampiric nature. And who seems to have a new man in her life. Some days, it just doesn’t pay to get out of bed. No matter how much you’re charging.
