"Ever since October 1967, when he set off in a battered motor home to explore America and talk to its people, Charles Kuralt has been one of our premier chroniclers, a man who has helped us to see and celebrate our country in a way we never had before." "He takes us to Montana in September and Alaska in June, deep into Cajun country in winter and along the North Carolina mountains in spring. He explores Charleston and the Florida Keys, the coast of Maine and the deserts of New Mexico, the boundary waters of northern Minnesota and the back roads of Vermont when the oaks and maples turn to crimson and gold." "Throughout, his accounts are filled with people, stories, and experiences; suffused by a poet's love of language; rich in the spirit and flavor of this infinite and varied land. Here is a book of pure reading pleasure - like its author, a national treasure."--BOOK JACKET.Title Summary field provided by Blackwell North America, Inc. All Rights Reserved
