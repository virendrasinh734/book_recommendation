To hold onto her inheritance, Caroline must marry. But getting a husband isn't easy, because her estate is haunted by Lord Hamilton. Desperate, she marries a rake from one of the worst criminal districts in London. As she falls in love with him, she wonders if he is possessed by the ghost. This lighthearted Regency romance is a departure for Beard.
