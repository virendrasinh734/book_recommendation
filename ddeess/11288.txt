Book 1 in, The O'Malley Series. A CBA Bestseller. Kate O'Malley's specialty is hostage situations, and she's learned to depend only on herself in a crisis. But now Kate's a target. Someone's been sending her black roses . . . maybe the same person who just blew up an airplane and blamed her. Faced with the shocking evidence that the bomber may be someone she knows, Kate has to decide if FBI special agent Dave Richman - and the God he trusts so implicitly - is all he's supposed to be.
