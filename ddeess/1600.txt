From the nationally bestselling author of Fairest of Them All comes this bewitching time-travel romance that shimmers with love and laughter. An enchantress from seventeenth-century Massachusetts collides with a future beyond her imagining . . . and with a handsome cynic who’s about to learn a lesson in the power of love. Arian Whitewood hadn’t quite gotten the hang of the powerful amulet she’d inherited from her mother, but she never expected it to whisk her more than three hundred years into the future. Flying unsteadily on her broomstick, she suddenly finds herself among towers of glass and metal, then tumbling from the sky to land at the feet of a man with frost-gray eyes and a seemingly flint-hard heart. Reclusive billionaire Tristan Lennox didn’t believe in magic, but he had his own reasons for offering one million dollars to anyone who could prove it existed. Now he finds himself besieged by fakes, frauds, and an old nemesis ready to leap on this opportunity to destroy him. But the smoky-voiced beauty who appeared to fall from the clouds into his climate-controlled existence is something else entirely—a woman able to enchant his lonely heart with wonder, but who can’t possibly be what she seems.
