From the New York Times bestselling Jane Feather, author of To Kiss a Spy and Kissed by Shadows, comes a deliciously sensual tale of intrigue and temptation… The last thing Lord Nicholas Kincaid expected to see in the gloom of a London tavern was a vision of loveliness. And when she led him to a bedchamber with a come-hither smile, there was no question of resisting—until he realized the lying wench meant to render him senseless so the landlord could rob him blind! That’s how the handsome lord made the acquaintance of Miss Polly Wyat, a ravishing beauty he soon decided would make the perfect spy. Unwittingly, she would infiltrate the inner circle at the king’s court. But when Nicholas sets out to bind Polly with chains of passion, he’ll find himself hard-pressed not to be bewitched…or to fall in love.
