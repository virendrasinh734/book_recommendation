Fears of Frankenfood, e-coli and "mad cow" meat abound. If, indeed, we are what we eat, what in the world are we becoming? John Robbins, who revolutionized how we think about food, reveals the truth about our already deadly diet. He boldly posits that, collectively, our personal diet can save ourselves and the world. If, according to chaos theory, the beating of a butterfly's wing can cause a hurricane in another part of the world, try this out for chaotic cause and effect: monarch butterflies are dying in droves due to genetically-engineered corn growing in the Midwest. There is also a direct correlation between the Big Mac in your hand and the mile-wide river now running across the North Pole. Learn the truth about foods we are eating that are, in Robbins' words, "unsafe on any plate."
