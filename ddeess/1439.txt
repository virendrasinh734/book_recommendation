Anna Pigeon, park ranger and fortyish heroine is back. Anna has been assigned to work on a scientific project that has her hanging out bait of blood and guts to attract the big grizzlies in Glacier National Park. When a body turns up in a remote corner of the park, and it becomes clear that death was met at the hands of a human rather that the claws of a grizzly, Anna goes on the hunt for a killer.
