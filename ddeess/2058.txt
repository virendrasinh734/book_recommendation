Three favorite historical romance authors have created delightful stories that capture the magic of Christmas. In A Highland Christmas, a woman forced into marriage loses her heart to her English bridegroom. In Sara's Gift, a woman falls in love with the father of the girl she gave up for adoption while they're snowbound in Montana. And in When All Through the Night, a woman finds love anew with the newspaperman who once broke her heart.
