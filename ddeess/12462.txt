Joy Anderson was young and trusting when she served as a guide for aspiring journalist Gabe Venture. Surrounded by the staggering natural beauty of New Mexico's Lost River Cave, Joy gave herself freely to the most extraordinary man she had ever known. But even the passion they shared could not hold him—and Gabe left Joy with a broken heart . . . and, nine months later, with a cherished, if painful, reminder of their lost love. Now Joy is a respected doctor with no room in her life for shattered dreams. And Gabe has returned at the pinnacle of his profession, longing to fill the inner emptiness that has rendered his achievements bittersweet. Joy, however, has nursed her wounds and moved on; he has arrived far too late to be welcomed back into her heart. But while there is still magic beneath the rolling New Mexican desert—in the breathtaking world of mystery and wonder where the miracle was born—can it ever be too late for love?
