Now with Lady of Desire, a sizzling tale in which a fiery young temptress tames the king of thieves, she delivers her most enthralling–and smoldering–novel yet. . . . Impetuous Lady Jacinda Knight is the daughter of a scandalous woman. Though society predicts she’ll follow in her mother’s footsteps, the spirited beauty stands unashamed of her passionate nature.

His stolen kisses awaken in her a longing for a man she can never possess.

Having turned his back on the privilege and power of his tyrannical father’s house years before, he vows to return to his rightful place and reclaim his title, Earl of Rackford–to win the love of the ravishing beauty who has stolen his heart . . .
