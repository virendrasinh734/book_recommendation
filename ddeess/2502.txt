Caitlyn was an orphaned beauty with no future -- until the rugged outlaw nobleman rescued her from the streets. And now they ride together in the shadows of the night -- on the run from corrupt minions of the law -- emboldened by the exhilarating heat of the chase...and by a love as wild and free as the wind on the moors. Caitlyn has vowed she will never forsake Connor, her brave champion, her sensuous lover. But to save Connor, she must now betray him. Yet the proud lady can never betray the passion that joins their hearts...and draws Connor into harm's way to rescue his cherished love once more.
