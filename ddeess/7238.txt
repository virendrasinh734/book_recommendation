Can a man this bad… Jonni Landry DeVries was nuts to have let her twin sister, "the Love Doctor," talk her into opening her stately New Orleans home to a Hollywood film crew. Struggling to recover from a marriage that ended in tragedy and protective of her impressionable young daughter, Jonni's sure the last thing she needs crossing her threshold is Cameron Scott, the notorious Hollywood womanizer! If only all men were like the refined actor who plays “Mr. Benjamin.” But the infamous Mr. Scott is another story, and she's more determined than ever to resist the bad boy's considerable sex appeal. Ah, but Cameron is a better actor than Jonni imagines… …be too good to be true? Cameron Scott is amazed that Jonni, the lovely hostess he's been spending every free moment with, doesn't see through his clever costume. Even worse, she's come to like Mr. Benjamin, but has made it clear that she wants nothing to do with the disreputable Cameron Scott. Will she forgive him when he's unmasked -- and give him a chance to prove that he's not the cad the tabloids make him out to be? Or will she toss him out before the final reel runs?
