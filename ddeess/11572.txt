He just never expected that nanny to be the lovely Grace Talmadge--who was easy on the eyes...and a terrible temptation to a commitment-wary cowboy's heart.Grace liked her life safe and secure, but living with her rugged boss and his bone-melting kisses was likely to get even the most sensible girl into trouble. She and Wyatt were complete opposites, yet Grace found herself falling for this wild cowboy. Could she take a chance and lasso the love of a lifetime?
