From the author of Master of Murder. Teresa is running away from home, when she picks up two mysterious hitchhikers. As they ride, they tell stories: of romance gone sour; of a sad young woman; of a talented young man with a violent temper. Yet, as they talk, a darker story unfolds around them. A story of life and death, of redemption and damnation. . . .
