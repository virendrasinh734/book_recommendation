Acclaimed as among the twenty greatest post-war American novels, Mrs. Caliban has all the elements of a late-night movie: unnatural sex, a demon lover, a fatal car chase, a jasmine hint of M. Butterfly, and a dash of X-Files. A mesmerizing tale that haunts and transports the reader long after the last page.
