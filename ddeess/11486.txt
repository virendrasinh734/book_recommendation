Thanks to a smash hit Disney Channel movie, we are reissuing the first two books in this popular series with fabulous new covers! Twins. Witches. Exactly. Camryn and Alex are identical twins -- and witches -- but they haven't always known that. Separated at birth and taken from their witch parents, the two girls have grown up on opposite sides of the country, and with opposite attitudes: Cam is preppy and popular, Alex is punky and brooding. When a chance encounter brings them together at 13, they discover their shared magical powers, and learn how to put those powers to use to solve mysteries, and save a life. But will they ever learn the truth about their past?
