The author of the multi-million-copy bestselling Politcally Correct books now turns his jaundiced eye to the eschatalogical--and generates big yucks at what he sees. Lampooning everything from Mad Max to the Rapture to 666, the Number of the Beast, James Finn Garner launches an assault on UFO conspiracies, numerological calculations of the last days, harmonic convergences, and other millennial prophecies.
