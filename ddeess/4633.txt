These tales of everyday struggles and triumphs introduce Dave, owner of the Vinyl Cafe, a tiny record store, and his wife, Morley, and chronicle their valiant attempts to rise to the unpredictable challenges of modern life. In these hymns to common foibles and absurdities, nothing ever quite goes according to plan. In the hands of internationally bestselling author Stuart McLean, host of the popular CBC Radio show The Vinyl Cafe and a master storyteller often compared to E. B. White and Garrison Keillor, Home from the Vinyl Cafe (A Year of Stories) captures the melodies of daily life and the harmonious sounds of pets, family, friends, and neighbors.
