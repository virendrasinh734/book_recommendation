In this fascinating book, the incomparable John Edward tells you how to communicate with those on the Other Side, what to expect when you cross over, and how to vanquish any fears you may have. Crossing over is a natural, peaceful, and loving experience, he tells us, that will serve as a wondrous reunion with your loved ones from this life and other lives.John also shows you how to use tools such as meditation and visualization to contact your angels and guides. The difference between angels and guides, he says, is that an angle is an energy that has never had a physical incarnation, but who can assist, protect, nurture, and inspire the human condition. A guide may have a physical body at one time, and works with you when you choose to incarnate into the physical. This energy stays with you throughout your life to help you in every way.John also goes on to discuss how to understand the power of your own psychic abilities. He insists that everyone has psychic gifts, but most of the time theyhave been locked away in the recesses of the mind and need to be developed and recognized. You must give yourself permission to perceive and receive energy, and then use spiritual tools to enable you unleash your potential as you embark on your psychic and spiritual journey.
