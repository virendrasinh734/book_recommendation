In 1661, a brother and sister staggered off a small wooden ship after eleven perilous weeks at sea to seek a new life in the Dutch settlement of Nieuw Amsterdam. Bound to each other by blood and necessity, gifted healers both, as their new lives unfold, betrayal and murder will make them deadly enemies. Their descendents -- dedicated physicians and surgeons, pirates and whoremasters -- will shape the future of medicine and the growing city. City of Dreams follows the stories of the Turners and the DeVreys in a city where slaves were burned alive on Wall Street, where James Madison, Thomas Jefferson, and John Adams walked the Broad Way arguing America's destiny, and where one of the greatest hospitals in the world would be born in a former shipwright's workshops by the East River. Set against the panorama of a young country's struggle for freedom, rich in history and medical detail, it is an enthralling tale told by a master storyteller.
