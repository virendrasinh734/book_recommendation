Clive Barker creates an unforgettable realm, the Imajica--five dominions of which one, the Earth, is isolated from the others. Formerly published as one volume, Imajica is now available as Books I and II. The stunning new repackage will appeal to old fans of the book and will draw new readers to this classic work.
