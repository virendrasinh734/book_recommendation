A powerful breakout novel of suspense in the tradition of James Petterson's Along Came a Spider. Taking place in one storm-swept night, this richly atmospheric novel plunges the reader into a nightmare world of an escaped psychopath determined to track down the woman who helped put him away. "A hayburner of a haunting story and a page-turning thriller".--Gregory McDonald, author of the Fletch series. Ad in People magazine (Top 10 Edition).
