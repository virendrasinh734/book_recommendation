When a traveling antiques appraisal show comes to Chicago, Nancy, Bess, and George take some "treasures" to the experts. A dealer finds a rare tape by a famous rock group in George's old reel-to-reel tape recorder, but the tape is soon stolen--like many other items brought to the show. Nancy discovers a mix of suspects, and she must determine who has been overcome by greed.
