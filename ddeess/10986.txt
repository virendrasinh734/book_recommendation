It takes just an instant for a family's life to be changed forever. Now seven-year-old Frankie Heywood lies in a coma. The experts are telling her parents there is no hope. Their son is slipping away emotionally. And the Heywoods--their marriage already strained to the breaking point--are desperate. They have one last chance. Dr. Elizabeth Chase is a brilliant neurologist who has dedicated her life to coaxing children back from the darkness. Her work is unconventional, controversial--and some say illegal. But the Heywoods have put their trust in her. They are convinced their daughter is waiting just beyond their reach. And they believe Dr. Chase is the miracle worker who can throw Frankie the lifeline that will lead their child back to them. But not even miracles occur without a price.
