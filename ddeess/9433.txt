Blessed with brains and beauty, Karen has created Mastermind--a computer program that can change the world. It has already changed hers. Suddenly she has a life beyond the computer screen--and two men who want to share it. Life should be perfect, but it's not. Someone wants Mastermind and will kill to get it. No one is safe and everyone's a suspect--even the people Karen loves most.
