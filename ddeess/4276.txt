“A great thriller: breakneck pacing, electrifying courtroom scenes, and a cast of richly crafted characters.”—People Mark Dooher is a prosperous San Francisco attorney and a prominent Catholic, the last person anyone would suspect of a brutal crime. But Dooher, a paragon of success and a master of all he touches, is about to be indicted for murder. Charged with savagely killing his own wife, Dooher is fighting for his reputation and his life in a high-profile case that is drawing dozens of lives into its wake—from former spouses to former friends, from a beautiful, naive young attorney to a defense lawyer whose own salvation depends on getting his client off. Now, as the trial builds to a crescendo, as evidence is sifted and witnesses discredited, as a good cop tries to pick up the pieces of his shattered life and a D.A. risks her career, the truth about Mark Dooher is about to explode. For in a trial that will change the lives of everyone it touches, there is one thing that no one knows—until it is much too late. . . . Praise for Guilt “A well-paced legal thriller . . . one of the best in this flourishing genre to come along in a while.”—The Washington Post Book World “Begin [Guilt] over a weekend . . . If you start during the workweek, you will be up very late, and your pleasure will be tainted with, well, guilt.”—The Philadelphia Inquirer “A wonderful novel . . . reminiscent of Scott Turow. John Lescroart isn’t a lawyer, but he writes like one.”—Dayton Daily News “Crackling legal action . . . robust and intelligent entertainment.”—Publishers Weekly
