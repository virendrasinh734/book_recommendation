Some like it hot “Delightful . . . Ms. Pickard has given the protagonist a new least on life!”—The New York Times When Eugenia Potter receives an urgent phone call from the manager of her ranch near Tucson, she's only too happy to drop everything and fly home. Something inside of her is calling her back to the desert. Why else would be preparing spicy Mexican meatball soup at her cottage in Maine when the menu clearly calls for clam chowder? But once she arrives home, Mrs. Potter discovers that her ranch manager and his granddaughter are missing from her ranch, Las Palomas, and feared dead.

And it doesn't hurt to have the help of a long-lost beau to spice up the danger with romance . . .
