Michael Havelock's world died on a moonlit beach on the Costa Brava. He watches as his partner and lover, Jenna, double agent, was efficiently gunned down by his own agency. There was nothing left for him but to quit the game, get out. Until, in one frantic moment on a crowded railroad platform in Rome, Havelock saw his Jenna--alive. From then on, he was marked for death by both U.S. and Russian assassins. Copyright Â© Libri GmbH. All rights reserved.
