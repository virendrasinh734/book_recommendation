Small-town Louisiana doctor Daniel Wyatt has everything: a solid marriage, a successful practice, and a prestigious nomination to the post of Surgeon General of the United States. That is, until one weekend of infidelity and a pregnancy threaten to shatter it all. Accused of murdering his own unborn child by slipping the mother the controversial abortion pill, RU-486, Wyatt's case goes far beyond jeopardizing his own life and career. With his trial imminent, a national scandal is underway, pitting eager pro-choice and pro-life proponents against one another, each side awarethat the verdict will have national implications. The small town of Lafayette becomes the latest hot spot in the debate about abortion, and thousands of people congregate to shout their is support for either side. One, in particular, a deadly terrorist who has been killing "abortion doctors" across the country. Inspired by the national media's attention, this killer now has the perfect opportunity to teach the country a vicious lesson. In an electrifying trial that reverberates with the media frenzy and high emotions of a case that could set the stage for overturning Roe v. Wade, Wyatt faces the fight of his life -- not only in the courtroom, but also against a madman who is targeting him on behalf of the unborn.
