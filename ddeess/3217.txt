In his new book, Dr. Weil explains how the mechanisms and processes of the body's healing system work. He delineates the ways in which an individual can optimize the functioning of his or her own system, and he explains the effects of the eight-week program, conceived to harness and support the internal healing system of our bodies. Incorporating alternative medicines and treatments, he gives specific and detailed information on diet, exercise, stress reduction, breathing techniques, vitamins, supplements, herbs, and all the other components in the eight-week program. He customizes programs for special groups of people: pregnant women, overweight people, recovering alcoholics and drug abusers, those dealing with or overcoming heart problems, former cancer sufferers, people over 65, and a dozen other categories. Building on the breakthrough thinking of Spontaneous Healing and drawing on the experiences of patients who have adopted his program, Dr. Weil's Eight Weeks to Optimum Health provides an invaluable means to maintain health and lessen the need for medical intervention.
