All roads don't lead to the village of Ashdown Dean. The one that did led writer Polly Praed right to the police station... to be questioned about a corpse. Poor Polly admitted to opening the phone booth door, but the dead woman had fallen out quite on her own. Now Polly needed to phone again - to call Melrose Plant and Scotland Yard's Richard Jury for help. For something was rotten in Ashdown Dean. Pets were missing. Some had been found dead.
