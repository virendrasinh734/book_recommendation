Mary Kirchoff (author of KENDERMORE & co-author of FLINT, THE KING, two other DRAGONLANCE tm saga novels) & leading game editor & designer Steve Winter combine to present the second novel in the Meeting Sextet, a series describing the lives of the Heros of the Lance before the companions ever met. In WANDERLUST, the kender, Tasslehoff Burrfoot, dwarf Flint Fireforge, & half-elf Tanis are swept up in a mad dash to stop an evil mage from misusing a sea elf princess's magic bracelet. The DRAGONLANCE saga has been read by millions of people around the world & has consistently hit the New York Times bestseller list. Mary Kirchoff's use of humor & strong characterization are particularly appealing.
