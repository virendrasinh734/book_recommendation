This clever bit of literary mischief is an "exquisite, exuberant, X-rated" ("Mirabella") novel about an imaginary eleventh-century Japanese writer. Onogoro, poet and concubine of the general Motosuke, hides a stable boy behind the screen at the head of her bed to spice up her love life with her master.
