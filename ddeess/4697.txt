After a messy breakup, Atlanta police detective Frankie Daniels is transferred to small Purdyville, South Carolina. Arriving to find her rental home in flames, she proceeds to chew out one of the locals--who turns out to be Sheriff Matt Webber, her new boss. But Matt is more intrigued than angry with his new deputy. He suspects that underneath her tough-cookie exterior, Frankie has a soft spot--and he hopes it's for him.
