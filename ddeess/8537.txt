Getting there is supposed to be half the fun, but #1 New York Times bestselling author Dean Koontz shows readers just how bad a cross-country trip can get... The van was in back of them again. Closer this time. There could be no mistakeâ€”they were being followed. But why? The question kept nagging at Alex and Colin as they left Philadelphia behind and sped toward their new home in San Francisco. Courtney would be waiting for them, ready to begin a wonderful new life with her husband, her brother... Now, someone else is driving cross-country to see Courtney, too. Someone whose brain is rotting inside. Someone who knows their route, their stops, even their destination. And he won't rest until he finds them.
