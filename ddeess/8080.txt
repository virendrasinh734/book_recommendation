A wickedly funny Robert Ludlum you've never met before. All the explosive paving of "The Bourne Identity," the Byzantine treachery of "The Parsifal Mosaic," the relentless action of "The Bourne Ultimatum." The Principal Cast: General Mackenzie Hawkings, legend, hero, rogue. Sam Devereaux, bright young lawyer from Harvard, now in the army, can't wait to get out. General Hawken's four ex-wives, a quartet of incredibly endowed women who've formed a club: Hawkin's Harem. The Premise: Kidnap Pope Francesco I, the most beloved pontiff since John XX III. Ransom: One American dollar for every Catholic in the world. The Problem: Pope Francesco I says: " Gentle souls, why not?"
