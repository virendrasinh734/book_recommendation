"I found deep comfort in realizing that Jesus loves even me, a ragamuffin, just as I am and not as I should be, that he accepts me, though I am most unacceptable. I came to this book hungry; I tasted and saw afresh that our God truly is good and that he is, after all, for us".-----Michael Card, Musican
