"Alice in Wonderland" meets "Wall Street" in Jerry Jay Carroll's brilliant and witty debut novel. A high-powered executive gets a real lesson in looking out for number one when he wakes up as a dog. Gone are the stock reports, limos, and cocktail parties. In their place are fairy-tale forests, magical creatures and hideous monsters. It's a world where you're either good or evil. Our hero decides to explore both options before choosing.
