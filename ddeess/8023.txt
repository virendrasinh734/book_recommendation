For decades, Gloria Steinem has led a social revolution against injustice. In Revolution from Within -- called "the ultimate self-help book" by the Los Angeles Times -- she sets out to restore the self-authority that such injustice has undermined. "A fine triumph...Succeeds in holding the feminist course while expanding its horizons to include everyone." --Time "Revolution from Within has a special sweetness -- that of triumph. Gloria Steinem dared to look behind the bravely smiling face she presented to the world for many years to encounter a not-so-bravely-smiling inner self. This meeting will strike sparks of recognition and encouragement." --Alice Walker, author of The Color Purple
