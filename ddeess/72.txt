A "brilliant novel" (The New York Times) from the Nobel Prize-winning author that takes us deeply into the life of one manâ€”an Indian who, uprooted by the bloody tides of Third World history, has come to live in an isolated town at the bend of a great river in a newly independent African nation. Naipaul gives us the most convincing and disturbing vision yet of what happens in a place caught between the dangerously alluring modern world and its own tenacious past and traditions.
