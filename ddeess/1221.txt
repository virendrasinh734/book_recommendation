Modern women don't believe in love. Believing in love carries roughly the same stigma as halitosis. It's as old-fashioned as going on a diet (as opposed to a detox).. . . I know all that and yet I do With her first two irresistible novels, Anna Maxted won the hearts of readers everywhere. Now, in Behaving Like Adults, she introduces us to twenty-nine-year-old Holly, the sunny, optimistic owner of Girl Meets Boy, a dating service for those who are "beautiful inside and out." She's ambitious -- and successful -- with her matchmaking, but she hasn't quite fulfilled her own relationship dreams (her ex-fianc√©, Nick, seems unlikely to progress from his job as Mr. Elephant, children's party entertainer). So when her friends dare her to pick a man off the top of the pile, she's game. But in one awful evening the perfect-on-paper Stuart turns out to be a thorough cad, and Holly's belief in the goodness of humanity takes a hit. How can she make good matches when she can no longer trust her ability to read people? What does this mean for her business -- and her romantic future? Holly's friends and colleagues are drawn into the complicated drama of her life, while Holly learns her most important lesson: to trust herself.
