This epic novel is centred on Napoleon's war with Russia. It expresses Tolstoy's view that history is an inexorable process which man cannot influence. Three of the characters, Natasha Rostov, artless and delightful ; Prince Andrew Bolkonsky, world-weary ; and Pierre Bezukhov, idealistic; illustrate Tolstoy's philosophy.
