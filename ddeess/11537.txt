Follow one woman's inspiring journey in this heartwarming story by the New York Times bestselling author of The Story of Arthur Truluv and Night of Miracles. How often have you wanted to drop everything and just go? Well, this is exactly what Nan does one day: gets into her car and drives across the country, letting go of her daily troubles and embarking on a trip of self-discovery. For Nan, a mid-life crisis becomes a mid-life opportunity: an opportunity to put herself first. Through conversations with people she meets, letters to her husband, and her diary entries, Nan walks along a path of self-care, mindfulness, and positivity that can reawaken and lift her spirit, as well as transform herself into the woman she wants to be.
