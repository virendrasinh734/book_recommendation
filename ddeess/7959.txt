Now in paperback! "The #1 self-help book for 2000" (USA Today) and the #1 New York Times bestseller, with 1 million copies in print." After successfully helping hundreds of thousands of people take responsibility for their own actions, Dr. Phil McGraw now turns his expertise to the primary area of concern troubling most people: their relationships. In his tell-it-like-it-is style that already has influenced millions of Oprah viewers, "Dr. Phil" blows the whistle on the rhetoric of traditional "couples therapy" and instead tells you that -- no matter what state your relationship is in -- not only are you responsible for it, you are responsible for getting it back on track. By doing this, he offers readers the chance for further happiness through meaningful, fulfilling relationships that work. Dr. Phil McGraw sets the record straight on the most popular myths about what a good relationship is supposed to be, such as: Myth #1: A great relationship depends on a great meeting of the minds Myth #6: A great relationship lets you vent all your feelings Myth #7: A great relationship has nothing to do with sex
