A must-have board book for all baby bedtimes and gifting occasions. Good night, Gorilla. Good night, Elephant. It's bedtime at the zoo, and all the animals are going to sleep. Or are they? Who's that short, furry guy with the key in his hand and the mischievous grin? Good night, Giraffe. Good night, Hyena. Sneak along behind the zookeeper's back, and see who gets the last laugh in this riotous good-night romp. Also available in Spanish as Buenos noches, Gorila. Look for Peggy Rathmann's other lively favorites 10 Minutes Till Bedtime and The Day the Babies Crawled Away.
