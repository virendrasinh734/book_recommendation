The first in a sexy, adventurous trilogy featuring a medieval Scottish clan transported through time to modern-day Maine by a matchmaking wizard—from the New York Times bestselling author of the Spellbound Falls series. When a plane crash strands brilliant scientist Grace Sutter on an icy mountaintop in Maine, she finds herself alone in the wilderness with the only other surviving passenger—Greylen MacKeage,a sexy, medieval warrior who’s been tossed through time to find the woman he’s destined to love. Forced together to survive the harsh, wintry landscape, neither expects the fierce passion that flares between them. But Grace is not used to letting her heart take control, and Greylen will settle for nothing less than her heart’s surrender.
