It was a day of rejoicing on the African plain. A throng of animals had gathered to witness a great event--the presentation of the first cub born to Mufasa, the Lion King, and his queen, Sarabi. An old and wise baboon named Rafiki led the ceremony. Rafiki, the mystic of the Pride Lands, stood on Pride Rock and held the cub high for all to see. The animals below were filled with joy. The little creature held so high was the Pride Land's future King.
