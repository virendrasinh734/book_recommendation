Originally published in 1985, this is the first novel in Catherine Coulter's stunning Song series: Fire Song, Earth Song, and Secret Song-and the prequel Warrior's Song. In Medieval Cornwall, Kassia de Lorris of Brittany cheats death only to find herself wedded to a stranger-the ruthless warrior Lord Graelam de Moreton.
