The first in a new series introduces schoolteacher Willi Gallagher in the strange town of Nickleberry. Willi overhears two students whispering about witchcraft and murder while in the school library, but, of course, Willi can't jump to conclusions. It's not until one of her students is found dead that the town starts listening--and Willi must sift through clues to put the rumors, and the killer, to rest.
