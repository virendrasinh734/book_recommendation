This first-ever, all-in-one collection of Cleveland Amory's beloved Cat tales is a bona fide publishing event. Presented here in their entirety, these three books - each volume an international bestseller upon publication - have captured the hearts and the imaginations of readers everywhere, and made a four-footed celebrity of Amory's sublime companion, the redoubtable Polar Bear. The Cat Who Came for Christmas delightfully recounts the earliest adventures of Amory and Polar Bear, including their memorable meetings with Walter Cronkite, George C. Scott, and Cary Grant, not to mention those with a cat psychiatrist, an afghan in Central Park, a Kamikaze Kitten, and Herbert the Pigeon. The Cat and the Curmudgeon takes up where the first book ends, Amory and Polar Bear still stubbornly standing their ground in battles both domestic and foreign. The Best Cat Ever is the most humorous of Amory's books - and the most touching - a loving look back at the trials and adventures of man and cat, all of which end in a kind of triumphal truce.
