Highly acclaimed and wildly successful, Ethan Canin's first book combines exquisite precision, humor, and a rare maturity of observation, capturing those miraculous moments when life opens up and presents itself to us. Here are short stories by a writer under thirty that aren't about existential emptiness. Full of life, rich with personal history, plot, and revelation, the stories in Empeor of the Air are the work of an extraordinarily gifted young writer.
