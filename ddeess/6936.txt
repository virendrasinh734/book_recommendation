Buffy is having weird dreams--dreams that she's reliving the life of a former slayer in Salem, Massachusetts. When Xander and Giles start acting like they have ancient alter egos, the stage is set for a replay of the night the Master was trapped in another dimension. Only this time, the Master wants to rewrite history.
