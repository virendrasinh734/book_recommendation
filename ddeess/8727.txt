A young man suffering from Tourette's Syndrome desperately searches for steady work before his ex-wife can claim custody of their son. He accepts a job offer from his eccentric aunt to repair her old Hudson Valley mansion, and takes his girlfriend along to help. Sifting through the rubble, he discovers that the house has been vandalized by an almost superhuman rage. And when dead teenagers are found in the area, the violent path leads directly to the mansion's door. To end the horror, he must confront his family's past, and the dark side of his own soul.
