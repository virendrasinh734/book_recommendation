A visit with Bavia's royal family should have been a dream come true. But for American Annie Trevarren it was turning into a disaster. Prince Rafael intended to offer Annie a lesson in passion, but, instead, she teaches the arrogant prince that nothing is a greater ruler than love. This is the awaited sequel to Taming Charlotte, Linda Lael Miller's biggest selling novel to date.
