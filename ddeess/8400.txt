Lieutenant Seth Buchanan is investigating a murder scene when the supposed victim walks through the front door. Grace Fontaine is even more beautiful in person than she is in the portrait over her mantel, and Seth knows that she means trouble. But he's a cautious man, long accustomed to guarding his heart, and he's determined to continue the practice. Grace, however, has other ideas; Seth is the man she's been waiting for through all the long, lonely years she has spent as an unbelievably rich, impossibly beautiful child and woman. Thrown together by Seth's determination to solve the murder, the theft of three incredible diamonds, and the imminent threat to Grace's safety, the two struggle with the passion and the bond that pulls them together. Nora Roberts is a master at spinning a tale, and she doesn't miss a beat in this novel of love, murder, mystery, and obsession.
