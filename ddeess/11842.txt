A beautiful fashion buyer is still in love with someone from her past -- and now, she must choose between him and the man she's planning to marry. Kathleen, a smart and sophisticated woman, is ready to marry the man of her dreams -- but she's in love with someone else. Erik is a talented videographer who finds women easy to love but doesn't want to settle down. And Seth, the wealthy heir to a department store fortune, could give Kathleen everything she wants . . . except the one thing that would make her happy. All three of them are about to get caught up in a web of lies so fragile that one fateful encounter could tear it apart -- and force Kathleen to choose between her family and the needs of her own heart.
