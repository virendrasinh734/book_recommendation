Grow your heart three sizes and get in on all of the Grinch-mas cheer with this Christmas classic--the ultimate Dr. Seuss holiday book that no collection is complete without! Every Who down in Who-ville liked Christmas a lot . . . but the Grinch, who lived just north of Who-ville, did NOT! Not since "'Twas the night before Christmas" has the beginning of a Christmas tale been so instantly recognizable. This heartwarming story about the effects of the Christmas spirit will grow even the coldest and smallest of hearts. Like mistletoe, candy canes, and caroling, the Grinch is a mainstay of the holidays, and his story is the perfect gift for readers young and old. "Irrepressible and irresistible." --Kirkus Reviews
