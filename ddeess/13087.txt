A medieval melody begins in the prequel to the Song series from #1 New York Times bestselling author Catherine Coulter. Chandra de Avenell might look like a golden princess, but she fights like a warrior, dreams a warrior’s dreams, wears a warrior’s pride like a suit of armor. She wants to be strong, independent and free. She has no use at all for a husband. Enter the man her father has selected for her. Jerval de Vernon takes one look at Chandra, and he wants her. After he saves her from a very bad situation, he sets himself to wooing her, not an easy task. Now Jerval must figure out how to coerce Chandra into giving him her loyalty and trust—and maybe even her love. But his new wife has no intention of giving in easily...
