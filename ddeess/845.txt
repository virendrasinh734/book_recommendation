"Anne Reilly is beautiful, successful ... and terribly afraid. Demons from her past have come back to haunt her as her Chicago art gallery exhibits a notorious mad priest's paintings of obsession and horror. Suddenly Anne finds herself slipping into a hell she cannot escape, unable to free herself from a long-hidden secret or give herself to the fulfilling love of the man she so desperately needs. Father Blackie Ryan and other "angels" of the faith now join in her struggle against the mystery that threatens her life and her sanity-against the terror of things seen through a glass darkly, and feelings that lie closest to the heart."--BOOK COVER
