A pilot for the Mary Jean Cosmetics Corporation--a hopeless geek trapped in a cool guy's body--Tucker Case's troubles begin one very drunk morning at the Seattle airport Holiday Inn Lounge. Surrendering to the strident will of a call girl who wants desperately to join the Mile High Club, he proceeds to crash his shocking pink jet on the runway--totaling the plane and seriously damaging the organ that got him into this mess in the first place. Now, with his flying license revoked, his job and manhood demolished, facing a possible prison term or, worse, the murderous wrath of Mary Jean Dobbins and her corporate goons, Tuck has to run for his life toward the only employment opportunity left for him: piloting a Lear jet for a shady medical missionary and a sexy, naturally blond High Priestess on the remotest of Micronesian island hells. But first he has to get there, encountering spies, cannibals, journalists, and would-be bitch goddesses every step of the way. Traveling with his Filipino transvestite navigator and a fruit bat companion, Roberto, Tuck braves shark-infested waters and a typhoon before reaching the dark heart of a tropical paradise--all before his first day of work. A delightfully offbeat look at cargo cults, religious zeal, and pyramid schemes, Island of the Sequined Love Nun is Christopher Moore at his hilarious best. CHRISTOPHER MOORE is the author of three previous novels: Practical Demonkeeping, Coyote Blue, and Bloodsucking Fiends. He lives near Big Sur, California.
