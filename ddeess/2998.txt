"A THRILLER WITH NONSTOP ACTION." --The Armchair Detective When mobster Al Moroconi is charged with orchestrating a heinous crime against a young woman, the first defense attorney on the case mysteriously disappears. Now, Travis Byrne--a smart Dallas cop who recently traded his badge for a law degree--is appointed by a federal judge to speak for the defense. But just as the trial is getting under way, Moroconi shoots his way out of court custody, steals a car, and vanishes into the Dallas underworld--taking Travis's reputation with him. Suddenly the FBI is after Travis for a murder he didn't commit. The mob wants to kill him for a secret hit list he doesn't have. Running for his life, Travis comes to a horrifying realization: the charge against Moroconi is just a cover for something much bigger and more foul.... "Two lawyers on the lam from the mob, the cops, and the FBI move this tale through Dallas neighborhoods and corrupt institutions faster than a hanging judge can bang a gavel. . . . This novel proves as engaging as Bernhardt's earlier work, with its appealing pair of heroes." --Publishers Weekly "A straight-ahead thriller . . . A fun ride." --Tulsa World
