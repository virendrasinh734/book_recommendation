“Monica Ferris has a talent for vivid detail,” raves the Old Book Barn Gazette. And her heroine, needlecraft shop owner Betsy Devonshire, is “a great character” says Midwest Book Review. Now it’s up to Betsy to unravel a five-year-old murder case that refuses to die… Betsy is still new enough to Excelsior, Minnesota, to not know a scandal when she causes one. So, when she hires Foster Johns to fix her roof, the resulting uproar has her needled. The whole town has pinned a five-year-old unsolved double murder on him. Betsy believes Johns when he says he isn’t guilty. But she’ll have to use every stitch of her sleuthing skills to tie up all the loose ends that will prove his innocence once and for all.
