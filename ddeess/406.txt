Lily Dale is released early from prison under one condition: she must temporarily impersonate the wife of powerful gubernatorial candidate Quinn Westin. Lily is identical to Westin's runaway wife, Miriam. The transformation from convict to society woman goes smoothly and Quinn and Lily find themselves drawn to each other--for real. But as Lily discovers more about her "twin's" disappearance, she wonders if she can trust this man she can't seem to resist.
