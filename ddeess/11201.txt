There is an island off the west coast of Ireand called Inis Muruch--the island of the Mermaids--a world where myth is more powerful than truth, and where death is never as strong as the redemptive powers of family and love. It is here that Lisa Carey sets her lyrical and sensual first novel, weaving together the voices and lives of three generations of Irish and Irish-American women.
