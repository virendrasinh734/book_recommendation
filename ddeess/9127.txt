A twisted psychopath...a trail of violence...and a man and woman who will risk everything to stop him... Jean Marc Andreas wanted what was his by right. He was seeking justice—and he would use any means to get it. Juliette de Clement, a confidante of the royal family, could aid his search for the priceless treasure so many had killed to possess...and died to protect. But in eighteenth-century revolutionary France, a world of power and intrigue, soldiers and assassins, royalty and rebels, death could come in many forms and from any direction, and none more lethal—or more likely—than from the person you trusted most. Still, Jean and Juliette had no choice but to trust each other, because their very lives depended on it. Someone else was determined to have the Wind Dancer statue—and the legacy of power it bestowed. Someone whose twisted genius for evil was already wreaking a path of unspeakable violence that only together they could stop...even as they stood to be its next victims.
