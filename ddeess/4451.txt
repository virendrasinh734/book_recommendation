Alabama, 1956: While Elvis Presley was singing about love, one young woman was learning about life. Everyone loves Maggie Deloach, one of the most popular girls on campus with everything going for her. An impeccable lineage. Picture-perfect looks. The best sorority, and the best fraternity boy's pin. The ultimate Southern belle, Maggie knows what the rules are and is willing to play by them. No surprises are waiting in her future -- but neither are any disappointments. Then, amid the stifling heat of an Alabama summer, everything changes. There is talk of a racial revolution brewing, one that surely should not touch her protected world... but somehow does. There is growing sexual awareness that she knows should shock her... yet does not. There is a single act of defiance and courage that will forever alter the way others think of her... and how Maggie thinks herself. "An absolute gem... a rare and wonderful book." --Richmond News Leader
