"Keillor's best stuff is clean (in the sense that lines are clean), down to earth, exquisitely good-hearted, highly ludicrous, and as labored as nitrous oxide. This book will either leave you dumbfounded or happy -almost deservedly happy -to be anywhere" -The New York Times Book Review "His humor is cerebral and complex, a blend of romance and nostalgia; it sparklingly parodies the American (and human) condition. His stories and satires glow with a sense of time and place." -The Washington Post
