In ancient Greece, two sons are born to a noble Spartan family. One is strong and healthy, the other lame and feeble. Cruel Spartan law decrees that the crippled baby must be killed and his father reluctantly abandons him to the wolves of Mount Taygetus. But by chance, and unbeknown to his grieving parents, the child is found and saved by a Helot - the once proud race of men now enslaved by Sparta.
