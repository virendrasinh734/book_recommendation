The bestselling classic from New York Times bestselling author Linda Lael Miller about a rugged pair of twin brothers—the lawman and the gunslinger—and how they find the ladies of their dreams across the Old West. Marshal Shay McQuillan has a lot on his hands—stagecoach robbers to track, a murdered fiancé to avenge—and he doesn’t need an identical twin brother, who he never knew existed, turning up out of the blue. Then Shay’s world is truly shaken by lovely Aislinn Lethaby, a hotel worker who impulsively steps in to rescue him from danger! Is she a sweet distraction from his serious duties—or the answer to his lonely heart? Now that he has found his twin brother, all Tristan Saint-Laurent wants is to be a peaceful rancher. What he gets is Emily Starbuck, a determined package of trouble from back East. Tristan knows he should tell Emily and her aggravating sheep to move along, but he doesn’t have the heart. Suddenly, the gunslinger is dreaming of married bliss. But his past may yet come between him and the woman he has come to loves.
