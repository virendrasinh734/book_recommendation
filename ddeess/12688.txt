With the legal-behind-the-scenes finesse and courtroom drama of Presumed Inocent, Trial is a taut and exciting novel of a lawyer caught between two clients. He struggles to wrest justice from the complexity, subtlety and bald simplicity of the law, but gripping and surprising events will throw him more than a curve or two. Condensed in Reader's Digest.
