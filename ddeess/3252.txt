With James Patterson's feel for narrative drive combined with Joseph Wambaugh's ability to cut to the quick of police procedure, Donald Harstad is a fresh new voice in crime fiction. And with twenty-six years of experience as a deputy sheriff in a rural Iowa town, Harstad knows whereof he speaks. Inspired by actual events, "Eleven Days takes readers on a gripping and unforgettable journey inside a heartland community and unveils its darkest secrets. Iowa highway patrolman and deputy sheriff Carl Houseman is comfortable with his night-shift routine of speeding tickets and slow crawls through Nation County's two-stoplight towns. This is not to say that Nation County's Sheriff's Department--fueled by doughnuts, countless pots of coffee, and down-home disregard for the bizarre--hasn't had its trials and tribulations. But Houseman is in for the time of his life when a quiet weekend evening turns into eleven sleepless days after a 911 call from a terrified woman hits his dispatcher's office. Upon arrival at the crime scene--a deserted farmhouse that even Hitchcock wouldn't be able to duplicate--Houseman finds the woman gone and the owner slaughtered and mutilated. Down the lane, another farmhouse contains the bodies of four more victims, tortured before their deaths and all bearing the markings of a Satanic sacrifice. As the investigation gathers momentum, the dirty little secrets underneath the placid surface of the quaint Iowa community are revealed, and Houseman ends up fighting for his life against a force of unimaginable horror. Houseman's first-person narrative--terse, drawling, and unexpectedly funny--provides an irresistible invitation to a wild ride in the passenger seatof his patrol car. Buckle up.
