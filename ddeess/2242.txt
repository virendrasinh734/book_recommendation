Bestselling, award-winning author Shannon Drake returns with a sweeping new saga of medieval Scotland! Sir Arryn Graham had come to seek revenge against Kinsey Darrow for his bloody deeds against the Highland rebels. And he'd do it by claiming Darrow's bride, Kyra, for his own. But in the tangle of her lustrous hair and the emerald of her eyes, Arryn found a lady who was much more than a pawn. Conquered by this bold knight, Kyra embraced his savage passion, knowing it marked her as the king's enemy. Now she is running for her life, an outcast who may be hanged unless Arryn can save her with his courage...and redeem his own soul with love.
