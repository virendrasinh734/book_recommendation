New York Times bestselling author Lorraine Heath's classic novel of a love that overcomes all obstacles "I would not make a good husband. I do, however, make an excellent lover . . ." Harrison Bainbridge, the second son of an English earl, left his home seeking a scandal-free life away from society's stuffy restraints. Arriving in Texas, he never expected that a sassy saloon-keeper's daughter would capture his eye. With her outspoken ways and flashing eyes, Jessye Kane is a temptation hard to resist. But although she is willing to be his partner in a daring business venture, she is unwilling to embrace the passion he offers. Jessye knows that noble-born Harrison isn't for the likes of her, but beneath his devil-may-care exterior, she senses a deeper vulnerability. When he's suddenly injured, risking his life to save her from mortal danger, Jessye vows to do anything to make him whole againâ€” forcing this rugged scoundrel who claims he has no heart to take the greatest risk of all . . . on love.
