Kiss cellulite goodbye! The Fat Flush® Plan melts fat from hips, waist, and thighs in just two weeks and re-shapes your body while detoxifying your system. The Fat Flush Plan is a groundbreaking low carb/detox diet and fitness program. Fat Flush is known as the only diet program that gets rid of bloat, supports the liver, cleans up the lymph, and helps to eliminate the appearance of cellulite – for good. An international best-seller with legions of devoted followers, The Fat Flush Plan has been featured on "The View," as well as in cover articles in Time, Glamour, Self, and many others. It is based upon essential fats (such as flax seed oil and flax seeds), balanced proteins (including eggs, meat, fish, and moderate soy) plus low-glycemic healthy carbs from fat flushing fruits and vegetables. The Plan also features “cleansing” tonics such as unsweetened cranberry juice and water, the “Long Life Cocktail,” and daily hot water and lemon juice as well as a delicious array of fat burning, water regulating, and insulin controlling herbs and spices (think cayenne, mustard, cilantro, parsley, cinnamon, and cloves).
