Art historian Jennifer Bowen has been hired to keep an eye on spoiled 19-year-old heiress Maddie while Maddie studies in the south of France. Jennifer welcomes the free trip--and she'll be glad to get Maddie away from the influence of Boy, Maddie's lover and violent ex-con. But Jennifer never imagines the lengths Maddie will go to get what she wants--and what she wants is Boy, who is also in France. He weaves the willing Maddie into a web of evil as he seizes his chance to get closer to his beautiful heiress. And Jennifer soon finds herself fighting for her life.
