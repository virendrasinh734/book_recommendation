From "a master of the detective novel [and] one hell of a writer" (The Boston Globe) comes a coolly glittering gem of detective fiction that has haunted three generations of readers. A treasure worth killing for. Sam Spade, a slightly shopworn private eye with his own solitary code of ethics. A perfumed grafter named Joel Cairo, a fat man name Gutman, and Brigid Oâ€™Shaughnessy, a beautiful and treacherous woman whose loyalties shift at the drop of a dime. These are the ingredients of Dashiell Hammett's iconic, influential, and beloved The Maltese Falcon.
