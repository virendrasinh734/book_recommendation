To know Grady Sullivan is to love him . . . unless you're Annie Kendall. In that case, you absolutely can't stand the man. After all, smart, sassy Annie is here at Peevers Manor trying to prove she's the long-lost illegitimate granddaughter of a foul-tempered toilet paper tycoon. How's a girl supposed to focus on charming her way into an ornery old coot's will with this devilishly handsome bodyguard breathing down her neck - and filling her head with inappropriate impulses while he's at it?As noble protector of the lovely, bathroom tissue heiress, Grady has his work cut out for him. He can't let Annie out of his sight, let alone get her off his mind. Okay, maybe a gloomy old mansion crawling with unscrupulous - even murderous - gold-digging relatives and servants isn't the perfect place to woo a woman. All that matters is that Grady's smitten enough to put everything on the line for her, including his life - and his precious bachelorhood!
