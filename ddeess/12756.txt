The passengers of Meridian Flight 6—delayed for hours and mistreated by airline personnel—have been pushed to the edge. When Captain Phil Knight makes a forced emergency landing in war-torn Nigeria, abandoning his copilot to certain death, violence erupts inside the cabin. The enraged passengers attempt the unthinkable: the first-ever commercial airline mutiny. But what they don’t know could kill them. The unscheduled loss of radio contact has led NATO and the CIA to believe the worst—that the plane may have been hijacked.
