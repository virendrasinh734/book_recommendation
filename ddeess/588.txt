It was the perfect place to disappear . . . When Kacy Macgrath's life crumbled two years ago, she changed her name and escaped to her grandmother's cottage in Ireland. Here she lives anonymously, with no reminders of the past--except the terrifying images that continue to haunt her dreams. Images of the stormy night her husband Alex walked out on her--and fell into the raging waters near their Long Island home. After his death, Kacy uncovered secrets about Alex she was better off not knowing, so she ran away. Now someone is watching her. Braedon Roche has traveled across an ocean looking for justice--to expose Kacy Macgrath as a master forger who, along with her late husband, had nearly destroyed his career as an art dealer. What Braedon doesn't expect is his undeniable attraction to the fragile widow hiding behind a web of deception. But Braedon isn't the only man following Kacy. A savage killer stalks from the shadows, chipping away at her sanity, and trapping her in an unspeakable nightmare. . . .
