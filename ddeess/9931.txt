In the most advanced hospital in the world, medical computers ensure perfect care. But machines have no scruples. No compassion. No mercy. And now they have a mind of their own. Surgeon Chad Dunston helped create The Center, a revolutionary medical facility where computers, not humans, treat patients. Its cure rate is unequaled, its medical successes unrivaled...until a child named Christine Lassiter mysteriously dies. The girl's older sister Maxine can't get Christine's records, her body, or even her death certificate. Maxine wants Chad Dunston to find out what happened. But the more questions Chad asks, the more dead-end answers he receives. He has only one option left: check into The Center as a patient...and enter a machine-made nightmare, where the only way out may be death. Author of the best-selling medical thriller The Unborn, Dr. David Shobin has returned with a chilling cautionary tale about the direction of today's high-tech medicine...medical care without the caring, greed raging out of control, and deadly terror as the new specialty.
