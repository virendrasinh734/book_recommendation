"A novel that races along with all the alacrity of one of Kit's mounts at the Devon or Ascot race courses. A subtle twist at the end makes the jaunt all the more enjoyable." NEW YORK TIMES BOOK REVIEW In Kit Fielding's breakneck world of steeplechase racing, the ultimate catastrophe strikes: Someone is shooting horses. As Kit races to stop the murdering madness, everyone in his upper-crust circle becomes a suspect--the princely rival who's trying to woo his woman, the personal enemy bent on ruining his family, not to forget the black-market arms dealer whose plans could imperil the globe. Much as the civilized side of him hates to admit it, Kit wonders if he should steel himself to the use of force... From the Paperback edition.
