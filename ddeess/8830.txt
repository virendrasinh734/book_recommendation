Generations ago, the Aincourt family was gifted with an abbey by their king but with it they inherited a curse--no family member would ever know happiness. Devin Aincourt, a drinker, a gambler, and a womanizer, was cast out by his father. Now, Devin's mother asks him to restore the family name and fortune by marrying rich American heiress Miranda. But for Dev and Miranda, love may be the most lasting curse of all.
