From the author of "The Marriage Wager" comes a story of a prince who has no tolerance for a meddlesome ghost. To expel the spirit--that of an actress who committed suicide--from his London residence, the prince taps an Oxford-trained scientist who reluctantly plays ghostbuster. The very logical scholar considers the whole affair a prank, until he meets the deceased's daughter and uncovers a dark truth.
