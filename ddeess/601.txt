In a novel that races along like a hot desert wind, Freedman unleashes "one of the most extravagantly entertaining thrillers of the year" (Kirkus). Justice is blind--especially for criminal attorney Will Alexander who's trying the most hopeless case of his career. Convinced that his two motorcycle gang member-clients are innocent of murder, Will now must prove it to a ruthless D.A., a doubting judge, and a hostile jury.
