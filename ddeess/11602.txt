Her Future, and the Lives of her Young Siblings, is in the Hands of a Fancy "Englischer" from Portland...Sarah Cain. Lydia Cottrell, eldest of five Amish orphans, made a promise to her dying mother to "keep the family together." But soon she discovers that guardianship has been granted to a virtual stranger--a well-to-do aunt from Portland, Oregon, who cares little for Mamma's last wish. Lydia's struggle to keep the promise may cost her the loss of "the sweetest, kindest, and most handsome Plain boy in all of Lancaster County"--Levi King. A thoroughly modern young woman, Sarah Cain had ridiculed her sister's choice of a Plain life-style, which served only to intensify the lifelong rift between them. Now, twelve years later, Sarah is stunned by news of her sister's death and baffled by Ivy's choice of a guardian. How can Sarah sacrifice her successful career and a life she enjoys to raise five Amish orphans? And what of Bryan Ford, the man in her life? Upon her arrival in Lancaster County, Sarah holds a grief all her own--one very different from the suffering of her nieces and nephews. Can the sorrow that divides them ultimately unite the new family? Will Sarah discover that Lancaster County's Amish community is not only a simpler place, but also a healing place?
