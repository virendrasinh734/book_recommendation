"My motto has always been "If you're going to read, it might as well be a book... or a magazine... or even a newspaper, I guess." So, as you might imagine, I was awfully excited when I was asked to write a book myself. But after the celebration was over and all the champagne was gone, I realized I had to sit down and actually write it. I was sober when I wrote the book - kind of." "Okay I wasn't drunk or stoned. I was, however, nervous. But when I began writing, I realized that although I don't know a lot about any one thing, I know a little about a whole bunch of things: baking a pie; dancing; curing the common cold; running the Iditarod; explaining sex to children - it's all in the book. And I realized I notice things that maybe some people don't notice (or they don't notice that they notice): how we behave in elevators or airplanes or restrooms; why we're scared of the boogeyman (and believe me, we're scared of the boogeyman); how people sing songs the loudest when they don't know the lyrics." "But mostly my book is about how hard it is for someone who basically just wants to be liked to get things right and be understood. Does that make sense? I hope so. It's about how we strive and fail in so many of the small things in life but ultimately succeed in the larger things."--BOOK JACKET.Title Summary field provided by Blackwell North America, Inc.
