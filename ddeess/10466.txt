Harry Driscoll is living in New York City (if you call trying to survive on an editorial assistant's salary "living"). His family is wealthy (but Harry Driscoll is not). His education is Ivy League (but what good is it doing him?). His publishing job is entry level (with no exit in sight). BUT... Harry Driscoll has a dream (if you call an unfinished manuscript hidden in the closet a "dream"). Harry Driscoll has a girl (although intercourse is out of the question). Harry Driscoll even has feelings. (He asked this girl, one day in the park, to be in his life forever--and meant it!) And the other girls? They're not the problem. (The problem is, Harry Driscoll cannot allow himself to say the word "love.")
