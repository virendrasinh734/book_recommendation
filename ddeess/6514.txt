Lorraine Dancy has always been a dreamer, but she couldn't imagine finding her long lost father, getting framed for the theft of a priceless artifact and having to make a daring escape all in the same trip to Mexico. With both the cops and the local crime boss after her, she's pretty relieved--and completely smitten--when renegade Jack Keller comes to the rescue. She just hopes that they both live long enough to act out the rest of her romantic fantasy.
