He would defy the boundaries of time for one night in her arms . . . He was a mighty Scottish warrior who lived in a world bound by ancient laws and timeless magic. But no immortal powers could prepare the laird of Castle Brodie for the lovely accursed lass who stood before him. A terrible trick of fate had sent her 700 years back in time and into his private chamber to tempt him with her beautyâ€”and seduce him with a desire he could never fulfill. For this woman he burned to possess was also the woman he had foresworn to destroy.

But the powerful, naked warrior who stood glaring down at her was only too real . . . and too dangerously arousing.

Or that this man who had long ago forsaken love would defy time itself to claim her for his own. . . .
