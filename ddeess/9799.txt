In Jane Feather’s dazzling, irresistible romance, London’s most charming matchmakers are faced with a ruinous lawsuit—and now Prudence, the brainy, beautiful middle sister, must save them. Soon after the Duncan sisters’ personals service turns a profit, their controversial newspaper The Mayfair Lady offends a powerful earl—who is now determined to demolish them in court. In dire need of counsel, the women turn to England’s most sought after young barrister. Sir Gideon Malvern is notorious for his aggressive style—and his love of a challenge. Spirited Prudence, with her beauty unsuccessfully hidden behind spectacles and frumpy clothes, provides him with exactly that. But how in the world will the Duncan sisters be able to afford Gideon’s fee? Prudence proposes a barter: Gideon defends their case; they find him a bride. It’s an exchange of services even this most cynical single barrister cannot refuse.
