Five stories that epitomize Jack London's mastery of the adventure story. "The White Silence," "In a Far Country," and "An Odyssey of the North" bring the harshness of the frozen North powerfully to life. "The Seed of McCoy" reflects London's experiences as a sailor in the South Seas. "The Mexican" combines London's talents as a sports writer with a sympathetic portrayal of a prize fighter involved in the Mexican Revolution. Publisher's Note.
