California's Gold Coast is the home of boat parades, middle-aged women in bikinis, and Winnie Farlowe, a 40-year-old ex-cop with a strong interest in drinking. But when a beautiful and spirited three-time divorce e introduces him to her world of clubs and mansions--and the mystery of her father's death--he soon finds himself running for his life.
