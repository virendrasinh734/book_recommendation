"For over six years, Reginald Brooks has managed to pull it off. Having two families, leading two lives. Now, the pretending must stop. But how? THE GREAT PRETENDER is an electrifying tale of how one man tries to untangle his life, setting a full-fledged arena of wife against husband, lover against lover, friend against friend, and family against family. Once you begin this engaging tale, you will witness how one man's decision to pretend ricochets through the lives of several people. For some, escape could seem to be a most welcome solution. Reginald Brooks is a polished marketing VP who shrewdly built a dual life around his work. But without warning, that life begins to come apart at the seams and Reginald makes a decision that could threaten his very future and the lives of those he loves most. Tracy Brooks is Reginald's wife of nearly 20 years. While the cat's away, the mice will play. She's got secrets of her own to protect. Renee Jameson is the younger woman with the killer body who managed to turn Reginald's head long enough to become pregnant. From the plush streets of Miami to the glamour of New York City, follow the families of Reginald Brooks as their lives of sex, love, hate and surprise unfolds to an agonizing climax! This debut novel by Millenia Black is anticipated to spark a tantalizing blend of emotions, and may even leave you wondering if perhaps you know someone who might be THE GREAT PRETENDER. "
