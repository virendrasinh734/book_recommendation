A beautiful young woman's corpse is found along a highway. There's not a mark on her and an autopsy can't determine the cause of death. Rumor says her boyfriend, a prominent surgeon, will be charged with murder...unless Dan Sheridan can stop the indictment. Once a cop, now a hard-nosed defense attorney, Sheridan knows he's up against one of the most hostile and ambitious prosecutors in Boston. He also knows that someone has been tapping his phones. What he doesn't know is that his new secretary, a woman he's falling hard for, is an undercover FBI agent. Suddenly, Sheridan finds himself a pawn in a lethal game of power politics and revenge. With both his reputation and his client's vindication on the line, he'll fight betrayal with the one thing he has left on his side...justice. With keen insight and detail, Barry Reed depicts the seamy underside of an urban legal system in what is unquestionably his finest legal thriller yet. Full of twists and turns right up to the very end, The Indictment is a tale that crackles with electricity, and is impossible to put down.
