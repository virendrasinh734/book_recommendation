Uniquely packaged to appeal to the young reader with bright, colorful cover art, this Tor Classic tells of four sisters: Meg the beauty, Jo the rebel, Beth the peacekeeper, and Amy the dilettante. Their stories, their dreams, their romances, and their quarrels keep us turning page after page as they grow together into womanhood. Copyright Â© Libri GmbH. All rights reserved.
