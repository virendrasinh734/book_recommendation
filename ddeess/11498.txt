Joan Johnston presents the thrilling saga of two dynastic families, the Blackthornes and the Creeds, with this powerful New York Times bestseller -- a novel of intrigue, passion, ambition, and love set amid Houston's towering skyscrapers and the majestic plains of South Texas ranch country. Luke Creed has sacrificed everything for his career at the prestigious law firm DeWitt & Blackthorne: a chance to run his family's ranching empire, his marriage, even time with his two daughters. Defending a major client in a wrongful death case, Luke crosses paths with his high school sweetheart, Amy Hazeltine Nash, an advocate for the bereaved plaintiff. Now, Luke and Amy are divided by forces beyond themselves -- and overcome by an all-consuming desire. But when the case takes a deadly twist, Luke delves into a dangerous web of corruption that may place his life in jeopardy -- and may also target the one woman who loves Luke for who he really is: rebel, cowboy, loner, and lover.
