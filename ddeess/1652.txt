Meet Robin, Teal, and Phoebe again in the exciting sequel to Broken Wings. Three girls from different worlds with one thing in common: They were born to be wild. Robin... With a mom who's more absorbed in her singing career than in her own daughter, Robin's left to her own devices when the two move to Nashville. That's where her mom hopes to strike gold—and where Robin finds nothing but trouble. Teal... This rich girl will do anything to get her parents' attention...even break the law. But after she takes things too far for the guy she adores, Teal loses their trust completely—and is treated like a prisoner in her own home. Now there may be only one way out. Phoebe... She's the girl from the wrong side of the tracks, trying to make it in a fast new crowd. She moved in with her aunt to make a fresh start. But now her biggest mistake may be to trust a charming rich boy who could ruin her life and destroy her reputation forever.
