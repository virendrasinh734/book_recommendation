The dangerous task of acquiring rare and fabulous gems for the uniquely exquisite jewelry she crafts has taught Faith Donovan to be wary of anyone outside her own family. A man like Owen Walker is particularly suspect—a handsome and daring adventurer with an intimate knowledge of the ruby trade. Yet Owen is the one person Faith needs to trust as they venture together into the shadowy world of the wealthy and mysterious Montegeaus—a powerful Georgia clan descended from pirates and said to possess a staggering fortune in gems. A web of corruption and betrayal spreads out from historic Ruby Bayou, ensnaring two outsiders who have learned too much. Suddenly Faith and Walker are targets—endangered by the yearning of their hearts . . . and by the dark secrets of the legendary Blessing Chest.
