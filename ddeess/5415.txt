A lethally tantalizing novel by the New York Times bestselling author of Sticks & Scones When Goldy, owner of Goldilocks’ Catering, whips up a sumptuous lowfat feast for the Mignon Cosmetics’ company banquet, she discovers just how ugly the beauty biz can be! On the day of the banquet Goldy finds herself confronting an angry mob of demonstrators—“Spare the Hares”—who object to Mignon Cosmetics’ animal-testing policies. As she carries lowfat fare from her van to the mall where the banquet is being held, she hears an ominous squeal of tires and a horrifying thump. Seconds later a Mignon employee lies dead on the pavement. Now Goldy is enmeshed up to her sauté pans in a homicide investigation. Could the murder have had something to do with Spare the Hares—or with the exotic flower found near the dead body? Though busy serving up Hoisin Turkey and Grand Marnier Cranberry Muffins, Goldy starts sleuthing at Mignon’s million-dollar cosmetics counter. Soon the caterer-turned-sleuth knows she’ll be next on a killer’s hit list—and it won’t be pretty. Featuring original recipes for such luscious (and lowfat) dishes as Fettuccine Alfredo with Asparagus, decadent Fudge Soufflé, and irresistible what-to-do-with-all-the-egg-yolks bread!
