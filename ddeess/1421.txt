"Writers of popular fiction must have some gift of readability, but only a few have as unerring a narrative flair as Bernhardt. This is one of the best new series going." --Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine Out of corporate life and on his own, lawyer Ben Kincaid sees the seamy side of the law every day. There's no glamour and little reward when it comes to defending the lowlifes who beat down his door. But when a friend is set up for murder, Ben has no choice but to enter the world of hardball litigation and face a judge who despises him in a trial he is guaranteed to lose. BLIND JUSTICE is a riveting, emotion-packed thriller in which guilt and innocence remain obscure and justice is a matter of opinion. "Bernhardt is a master legal tour guide, taking the reader through the labyrinth of the judicial system of America's heartland." --Mostly Murder
