Whether she′s creating incomparable love stories of passion and redemption or breathtaking tales of romantic suspense, there is simply no finer storyteller at work today than the phenomenal New York Times bestseller Elizabeth Lowell. The bastard son of a viscount and a Cheyenne shaman′s daughter, Wolfe Lonetree agrees to rescue the pampered Lady Jessica from an unwanted impending wedding -- but only if she will be his wife. Naive and shockingly innocent, Lady Jessica Charteris tricked a rugged, handsome stranger into a marriage in name only in order to escape a union with a vile British lord. Totally unprepared for the hardships awaiting her in America, she is terrified by the prospect of life in the harsh and magnificent land at the edge of the Rockies. But even more frightening is Wolfe himself -- a man whose raw sensuality leaves her breathless. Her proud, virile new "husband" is not one to be trifled with, nor will he be denied what his heart fervently desires -- for only in Wolfe Lonetree′s arms can Jessica truly learn the unparalleled joy of becoming the right man′s woman.
