This first title in Greenwood's new series introduces the Night Riders, a team of Confederate raiders betrayed by one of their own. Cade, the Night Riders' captain, leads the team's survivors to his home ranch in Texas where dark-eyed temptress Pilar waits for him. War had changed them all, and Cade will allow nothing to come between them--not even Pilar's turncoat brother.
