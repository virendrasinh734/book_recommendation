How many times this week has your morning commute, or just plain driving to the grocery store, turned into a road-rage-inducing nightmare? A soccer mom steals your parking spot. A cell-phone guy cuts you off on the freeway. A student driver nearly rear-ends you at the mall. Take heart. Honku: The Zen Antidote to Road Rage is all you need to lower your blood pressure and make you forget that jerk in the yellow SUV. A collection of more than one hundred very funny haiku (or honku), this book shines its brights on the dark side of America's car culture. Distilling the daily horrors of driving, parking, and ordering from the drive-through into a time-honored and respected verse form, Honku transforms annoying moments behind the wheel into the stuff of poetry and will leave you in a state of enlightenment and bliss. Well, at the very least it'll make you laugh. A diverting read that may inspire you to pen your own haiku, Honku is the perfect fit for the glove compartment, to be pored over while you're stalled in traffic on the interstate.
