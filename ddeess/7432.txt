Top ten New York Times bestselling author J.A. Jance brings us another exhilarating thriller featuring Seattle homicide detective J.P. Beaumont. It looks like a classic crime of passion to Detective J.P. Beaumont: two corpses found lovingly entwined in a broom closet of the Seattle School District building. The prime suspect, Pete Kelsey, admits his slain spouse was no novice at adultery, yet he swears he had nothing to do with the brutal deaths of the errant school official and her clergyman-turned-security guard companion. Beau believes him, but there′s something the much sinned-upon widower′s not telling-and that spells serious trouble still to come. Because the secret that Pete′s protecting is even hotter than extra-marital sex.and it could prove more lethal than murder.
