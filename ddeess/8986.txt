"Memorable...Dr. Weil makes his case carefully and clearly." --The New York Times Book Review #1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER "This book is destined to become a classic." --Joan Borysenko, author of Minding the Body, Mending the Mind Drawing on fascinating case histories from his own practice as well as medical techniques he has observed in his travels around the world, Dr. Weil shows how the mechanisms of self-diagnosis and self-regeneration have worked to resolve life-threatening diseases, severe trauma, and chronic pain. But spontaneous healing is also the essential element in the maintenance of our basic daily health. The book outlines an eight-week program that each of us can use to alter our diet, avoid environmental toxins, and reduce stress in order to enhance our innate healing powers. The best medicine does not merely combat germs or suppress symptoms, but rather works hand in hand with the body's natural defenses to manage illness. Building on this fundamental truth and tapping into the intricate interaction of mind and body, Dr. Weil arrives at a major new synthesis of conventional and alternative medical treatments. At once practical and inspirational, Spontaneous Healing gives each one of us the power and the wisdom to draw on the sources of health we hold within.
