A New York Times BestsellerSpring has come to the Blue Ridge Mountains, and spring fever to the tiny town of Crozet. As the annual Dogwood Festival approaches, postmistress Mary Minor "Harry" Haristeen feels her own mating instincts stir. As for tiger cat Mrs. Murphy, her interest in the exploding bird population is intensified by a rare woodpecker, dead but unscathed, near the back porch. Feline intuition tells her more mysteries lie ahead. And they do. It begins with a case of stolen hubcaps and the mysterious death of a dissolute young mechanic. Then another death and a shooting lead to a startling discovery.
