Born to a serial killer, Jessica Shepard has devoted her life to tracking down men who destroy innocent lives. A survivor—and a loner—the hunt is her blood. She’s an expert. What does she want to forget? Then a man is found floating in San Francisco Bay—beaten to death with his flesh marked by a single cigarette burn. Jessica knows that this isn’t a routine case, and that he’s no ordinary victim. He’s a man she once knew intimately. For one single lonely night. And he’s not going to be the last of her lovers to die. Now, Jessica knows what no other cop does: the truth of what happened in the victims’ final hours. There’s just one problem—Jessica doesn’t remember a thing. And what she doesn’t remember could be the death of her. Now a major motion picture from Paramount.
