A famous country music star is shamed by her sister into going home to look after her bedridden mother. The town is dull, her mother gets on her nerves and the "dork" who had a crush on her in high school is once again after her. But with time she gets used to it, even falls in love with the dork. By the author of That Camden Summer.
