A New York Times Bestseller Charity -- beautiful, bold and wary of love after being abandoned as an infant, is bewildered by Kane Longstreet's marriage proposal. Despite her misgivings, she agrees to go home with Kane for the holidays where she gets the shock of her life. At his cousin's engagement party, she comes face-to-face with identical twin sisters Hope and Faith Butler, and sees a mirror image of herself. Hope -- the stunning discovery that she is a triplet does little to distract her from her own personal heartbreak. Jake Whitelaw, whom she has always loved, is about to marry someone else. Faith -- fearing Charity was given up for adoption because of her own special needs as a child, is guilt ridden. She vows to see both her sisters happy, whatever it takes. That means she's got to break up one wedding, arrange a couple more . . . and seize her own chance for happiness.
