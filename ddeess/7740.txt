In a small Texas town, murder brings home the unforgotten past. Twenty years ago, as Hurricane Althea lashed Central Texas, twelve-year-old Jordan Poteet and his friends decided to ride it out in their tree house. But in the still eye of the tempest, they raced for safety--and stumbled over the body of a beautiful girl. Now, the six schoolmates who shared the grisly sight of death so long ago are being coolly murdered, one by one, day by day. By whom? Why? Unless Jordan and Police Chief Junebug Moncrief, another survivor of the storm, can answer those questions fast, it will be their turn to die. . . .
