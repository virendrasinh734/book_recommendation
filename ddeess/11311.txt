Six seasons of bloopers, flubs, technical screw-ups, and picayune plot discrepancies for discriminating fans of Star Trek: The Next Generation Stardate 41153.7-46999.9 Starship Enterprise, Registry NCC-1701D We’re watching you. . . Is there a control panel inside the turbo lift? (No . . . except in the episode “Brothers”) Do or don’t personnel have to tap their badge to access their communicator? (Only when the writers feel like it) Yes, we’re fans. But we’re not unobservant. Some of us even have Vulcanlike logic. Author Phil Farrand figures that even if you love somebody, you can tell them about that dab of mustard on their upper lip. So here’s a compendium for Trekkers who are unafraid of pointing the finger at oversights, and who know it’s great fun to find the sloppy mistakes (or cost-cutting cheating) in a show that takes itself very seriously. So get your VCR ready and your mind set for hours of enjoyment and mental stimulation with: • Plot oversights • Production problems • Changed premises • Equipment oddities • Trivia questions • Fun facts • Covers every show for the first six seasons of Star Trek: The Next Generation • And more!
