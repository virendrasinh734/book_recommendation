After a pledge is found dead in an exclusive Sigma frat house, two students uncover a vast conspiracy of bribery, extortion, and other crimes. Sigma is a front for a super-secret criminal organization whose ultimate goal is to control nations. This successful debut "roars along with good characters, plenty of action, and dollops of dark humor" (James Patterson).
