The frontier spirit is alive and well in the old silver-mining town-turned-trendy resort of Aspen, Colorado, despite an influx of the rich and famous - and Regan Reilly. Regan has arrived with her mystery-writing mom and suave, funeral director father to spend the Christmas holidays on the slopes and visiting friends. Secretly, she wouldn't mind meeting a single man or two. She never expects to be rubbing shoulders, and maybe risking her neck, with varmints, desperadoes, or art thieves. Million-dollar paintings have been disappearing from elegant condos and chic chalets all over town. Suspicion immediately falls on a congenial ex-con caretaker named Eben Bean, who seems to have absconded with the loot. Worse, Regan not only knew and liked Eben, but also had helped him get his caretaking job. Now she may be the only person in town who believes he is innocent.
