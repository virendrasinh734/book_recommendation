THE FABULOUS HEROINE OF CHANCES RETURNS. SHE'S A HOT-BLOODED BEAUTY IN LOVE WITH POWER, HUNGRY FOR PLEASURE... WILD, NOTORIOUS, TROUBLE... SHE'S... LUCKY With the sensual grace of a panther, Lucky Santangelo prowled her Las Vegas casino, restless, ready, eager for action. That night began a dazzling odyssey, filled with dangerous passion and sun-drenched sex, sadistic vengeance and breathless suspense. From the decadent luxury of California, to Paris, New York and a private Greek island, Lucky fought for her father's honor, for ruthless triumph, for the wild card of a fabulous love. Her rivals; an ice-cold Hollywood wife... a much-married heiress strung out on cocaine... a jaded magnate hooked on power...a crazed hoodlum lusting for murder. But Lucky was a gambler and a lover, a woman who ruled her empire and pursued her man with the potent Santangelo strength... her way, on her terms, whatever the odds. Jackie Collins tops the sensational success of "Hollywood Wives" and "Chances" with "Lucky", "so hot it will have to be printed on asbestos." --Liz Smith, The New York Daily News Copyright Â© Libri GmbH.
