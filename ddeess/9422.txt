"For Alison Gill, mother of three young children, this year's much-needed family holiday at Fitzgerald's Hotel on the southeast coast of Ireland should be, as ever, absolute paradise. So when a work crisis forces her husband to return to Dublin, she is left angry, disappointed and susceptible to the confusing emotions surrounding a chance poolside encounter with Chris, an old flame from nearly twenty years ago." "In seeing him again, Alison cannot help but reflect on the passing of time, and sit in judgement on the life she has made for herself. Is this going to be a turning point, an opportunity to revive the passion and optimism of her youth? A final chance? Will she let herself be tempted?"--BOOK JACKET.Title Summary field provided by Blackwell North America, Inc. All Rights Reserved
