The hotly anticipated follow-up to 9-11, with over 250,000 copies sold, Power and Terror draws from a series of public talks that Chomsky gave in the spring of 2002, as well as a lengthy previously unpublished interview. Presenting Chomsky's latest thinking on terrorism, U.S. foreign policy and alternatives to violence as solutions to the world's problems, while also challenging the U.S. to apply the moral standards it demands of others its own actions, this book follows Chomsky's highly publicised visit to the U.K. and the release of his acclaimed eponymous documentary.
