A Ride On the Wild Side The last place Catherine MacPherson ever expected to find herself was sitting on a Greyhound bus, handcuffed to a surly bounty hunter, with only a suitcase of her twin sister's flashy, shrink-wrap clothing to wear! Just two hours ago, the respectable schoolteacher was sitting quietly at home when this bi macho hunk crashed through her door, mistook her for her errant Miami showgirl sister, and hauled her off in his strong arms. And no matter how sexy he is, she's furious! Twins-ha! Sam McKade's the last person to ever fall for that line. He's finally got the gorgeous, leggy redhead just where he wants her-and no matter what outrageous tricks she pulls, he's not letting her get away. The problem is, she's a lot smarter-and sweeter-than he'd expected. And he's got this deep-buried tenderness she hadn't expected. And their kisses are so hot, they just might burn up ... before they sort it all out.
