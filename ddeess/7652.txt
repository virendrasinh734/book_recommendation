Her babies were dying-one by one. Who would believe a mother would cold-bloodedly kill her two-week-old baby? That was why the law had to accept Paula Sims' story of a masked kidnapper. Then it happened again. Three and a half years later, Paula said she had lost another newborn to an intruder. But this time the police would not stop searching until they discovered the whole horrifying truth. This is the full, uncensored and terrifying story of twisted sexuality and hideous hate seething below the surface of a seemingly normal family ... and of the massive investigation and nerve-shattering trial that made the unthinkable undeniable. Written by the state's attorney who won the case against cruel odds and the reporter who covered it from the shocking start to suspenseful climax, Precious Victims is a riveting and chilling journey into the twisted heart of a family with a dark and murderous secret.
