Lady Sally's is an internationally notorious bordello. Lady Sally, like her famous husband, time-traveling bartender Mike Callahan, doesn't insist her customers even be human, as long as they have good manners. Small wonder, then, that she and her staff encounter beings like Diana the deadly dominatrix who cannot be disobeyed; Tony Donuts, the moronic man-monster even the Mafia won't mess with; or Charles, the werewolf with a distinct difference.
