Imagine a hot tub party where a married couple tests the boundaries of fidelity. A model who finds herself unaccountably aroused as she poses for a watercolor artist. A pool of water on a desert road and two lovers who know how to make the most of it. This is Aqua Erotica, a sensuous tasting of desire's liquid, ecstatic other worlds. Aqua Erotica is a siren's song, a book so unforgettably sexy that you will want to take it with you to the bath, the sauna, the night-lit pool. What's amazing is that you can. The first-ever waterproof book for adults. The most seductive collection of original literary erotica ever gathered under one cover. Aqua Erotica is a book that quite literally goes places you never imagined books could go. Featuring today's boldest erotic voices: Francesca Lia Block Poppy Z. Brite Louise Erdrich Carol Queen Marcy Sheiner Cecilia Tan Barry Yourgrau and many others --
