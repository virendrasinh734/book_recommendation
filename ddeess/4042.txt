Professional wrestler St. George the Dragonslayer is whisked back in time to the medieval English village of Markesew, which sacrifices virgins to a dragon. Years ago, Alizon was a sacrifice, but she escaped and took control of Devil's Mount. Now as George approaches, Alizon realizes George is not after the dragon, but has come for her heart.
