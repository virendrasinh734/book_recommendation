When investigator Leo Friday is sent to unravel the shady goings-on at the Kimball family mansion, he never dreamed his primary suspect would be pretty Lily Rigby, the eccentric family's social secretary. Everyone just loves Lily, and Leo can't help but notice that beneath that oh-so-sensible exterior is a passionate woman longing to break free. Leo finds Lily irresistible, trouble is, she might be filching millions of dollars from the Kimballs' overfilled coffers. Lily Rigby knew from the start that Leo Friday wasn't just another accountant sent to balance the Kimball family books. First, there were all those attractive muscles, a sure sign he did more in his spare time than crunch numbers. Then there were all those pesky questions about her personal life. But when he took her in his arms and gave her the most pulse-pounding kiss of her life, Lily was almost ready to put her suspicions aside. He couldn't be on to her--could he?
