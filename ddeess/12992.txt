With her stunning beauty, brilliant talent, and almost magical allure, the irresistible Katherine Tempest has the world at her feet. Her rise from unknown actress to Hollywood legend is one marked by dazzling performances and a carefully concealed, yet undeniably ruthless, determination to succeed. Katherine irrevocably changes the lives of her closest friends: the two men who love her, the woman who trusts her implicitly. She never looks back until she needs the one thing they alone can give her- forgiveness. As she did so masterfully in her magnificent trilogy of A Woman of Substance, Hold the Dream, and To Be the Best, Barbara Taylor Bradford draws us into a world of a strong and powerful woman who made her choices...then was left to live with them. Moving from the stages of London to the bright lights of Hollywood, this is a richly detailed and deeply emotional novel that comes straight from Barbara Taylor Bradford's heart to yours.
