Vince Cardozo is a New York cop who's seen too much and can't forget enough. Now this prince of the city has walked into a case that challenges everything he's ever believed about law and order. Corey Lyle is a cult leader tied to a bloody bombing and the murder of a prominent Manhattan couple. But as a woman prosecutor and a flamboyant defense attorney duel in court over Lyle's fate, a time bomb is ticking away: one juror is not the person she claims to be. Anne Bingham entered into the deception as a simple favor to her twin sister. Suddenly she's at the center of a storm of murder and kidnapping that could blow the Corey Lyle trial out of the water--and take away everything she holds dear.... Master storyteller Edward Stewart unleashes his most powerful novel yet--a blistering tale of deception, passion, and crime and punishment on both sides of the law.
