Published in 1983 to phenomenal reviews, Blue Highways: A Journey into America became a cult classic on par with Jack Kerouac's On the Road and John Steinbeck's Travels with Charley. In this highly acclaimed, bestselling memoir, a 38-year-old laid-off college professor of Sioux and white blood drives around the U.S. on the "blue highways, " the rural back made that are colored blue on old maps. The places he discovers during his 13,000-mile journey are unexpected, sometimes mysterious, and often full of simply the wonder of the ordinary.-- Blue Highways received extraordinary reviews when it was first published: -- The current trade paperback edition (Houghton Mifflin) sells 25,000 copies a year but will be out of print by August 1999.-- Heat Moon's long-awaited next book, River-Horse, will be out in September and will draw much attention to this important author. it will be supported by a 14-city author tour, national advertising, holiday catalogs, and NPR sponsorship.-- This edition of Blue Highways will include a new introduction by the author.
