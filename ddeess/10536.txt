In The Hope, world-famed historical novelist Herman Wouk told the riveting saga of the first twenty years of Israel's existence, culminating in its resounding triumph in the Six-Day War, which amazed the world as few events of this turbulent century have. With The Glory, Wouk rejoins the story of Israel's epic journey in one of his most compelling works yet. From the euphoric aftermath of that stunning victory in 1967, through the harrowing battles of the Yom Kippur War, the heroic Entebbe rescue, the historic Camp David Accords, and finally the celebration of forty years of independence and the opening of the road to peace, Wouk immerses us in the bloody battles, the devastating defeats, the elusive victories.
