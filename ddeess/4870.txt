Scott Adams has accomplished a rare feat. In his wildly successful cartoon strip, Dilbert, he has transformed the daily drudgery of the workplace into a fresh, comic commentary on life. Consider the cast: a devious and egomaniacal dog who fully intends to rule the world, a former lab rat so eager for acceptance that he's willing to work as a temp, a cat that is an evil HR directorâ€”and those are just the animals in Dilbert's world. Mix in the frustrated title character, his clueless pointy-haired boss, and an office full of insecure and dissatisfied white-collar workers and you get the hottest comic strip around. In I'm Not Anti-Business, I'm Anti-Idiot, Adams has truly found a way to relate the sometimes unbelievable craziness of the business world. Since Dilbert first gave a voice to discontented cubicle dwellers, the strip has consistently appeared at the top of comic page popularity polls. Today, the cartoon can be found stuck on office bulletin boards, personal computer monitors, and break-room refrigerators throughout the working world. This volume, I'm Not Anti-Business, I'm Anti-Idiot brings readers more of the bizarre fun. In it, they'll marvel at the escapades of Antina the non-stereotypical woman, who takes apart the office coffee machine "just for fun." They'll witness manager Ted, who just happens to have a beard growing from his forehead. And they'll recoil from Camping Carl, the office's nonstop self-storyteller, whom Dilbert manages to evade only by taking to his cubicle escape tunnel. No one captures modern office life like Adams, a former Pacific Bell employee. Dilbert evokes many laughs, tears, and "How did he know about our company?" comments from workers while at the same time appealing to supervisors who are certain they don't personally commit these managerial faux pas. I'm Not Anti-Business, I'm Anti-Idiot is guaranteed to deliver much, much more of what fans love most about Dilbert.
