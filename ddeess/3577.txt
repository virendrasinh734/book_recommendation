In this "intriguing" thriller (People), a New Orleans police officer kidnaps an attorney's wife in an act of revenge -- but he's not expecting the electric attraction between them. Burke Basile is a cop with nothing left to lose. Haunted by his partner's death, the end of his marriage, and the destruction of his career, he targets his nemesis, a flamboyant attorney who helps killers evade justice. Burke's shocking revenge centers around kidnapping Remy, the lawyer's trophy wife. But Burke hasn't planned on the scorching desire he'll feel for this desperate woman, who rose from the slums of New Orleans to marry a man she can never love. Nor can he predict the fierce duel that will explode as the clock ticks toward midnight on Fat Tuesday when all masks will be stripped away -- and Burke will be forced to confront his own terrifying secret.
