From the bestselling author of Lion’s Bride and The Ugly Duckling comes this passionate tale of danger, adventure, and romance that sweeps from a Saxon stronghold to a lovers’ bower in the cool, jade green forests of Wales. She was a prisoner bound by duty and desire. . . . Taken as a slave, fiery, tempestuous Brynn of Falkhaar was awed by the magnificent warrior who stood before her. Known for her skills as a healer, she had been brought to his battlefield tent to save his dying friend. Yet in the days and nights ahead, the sensual conqueror made it clear she might be more than nursemaid to his soldiers. She could be the intimate plaything of his seductive desires. He was a conqueror for whom nothing was forbidden. . . . Dark, brooding, and passionate, Lord Gage Dumont was a man used to conquest. And yet with one look at the beautiful slave he’s been given as his spoils, he realized she held him prisoner. As she fought to save his friend with her healing powers, Dumont felt her fiery touch deep in his scarred soul. Though he may have already owned her body, what he wanted was her heart—and for that he would risk everything.
