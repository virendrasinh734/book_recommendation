For nearly 10 years, FBI agent Ira Levitt has been tracking David Vandemark, a wily killer with a tragic past and a twisted ability to read criminal minds. His victims are drug dealers, child molesters, and serial killers. Levitt knows Vandemark cannot resist going after the Latino Killer, a cruel psychopath currently stalking Hispanic families. Yet the closer Levitt gets, the more he realizes Vandemark is not the man he seeks--an evil far greater and more sinister lies beneath.
