Now in paperback comes a wickedly funny first novel: a sly send-up of the fashion industry by a London insider. Katie Castle, fabulously witty and unabashedly vain, has inserted herself into the perfect life, working for a chic London designer. All comes crashing down, however, when Katie enjoys a fling with a vendor and loses her boyfriend, her job, and her apartment in quick succession. Copyright Â© Libri GmbH. All rights reserved.
