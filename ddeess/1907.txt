COINCIDENCE? NOT. Mick Dawson, undercover cop. He's got his hands full with a pushy broad who claims she's just in the wrong place at the wrong time. Except all the perps seem to know everything there is to know about her. Who're you going to believe? Only one way to find out. Get real close. Lela DeBraye (aka Del Piper), mystery writer. She's as confused as he is, but mostly because he's got the sweetest smile, when he smiles. Still, he's sticking with her twenty-four/seven -- is this love or duty? Is he her protector or her captor?
