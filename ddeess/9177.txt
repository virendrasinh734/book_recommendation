It's common knowledge in Plentiful, Wyoming, that bookstore owner Scarlett O'Malley imagines trouble brewing everywhere. Of course, real trouble bubbles over the day an enigmatic stranger named Logan Wolfe shows up in town. The outsider's one hunk of a guy, with a smile that could knock a redhead off her sky-high heels.

And when her wacky investigation takes a surprising turn, Logan finds himself glued to Scarlett's side, helping her look for clues, keeping her out of trouble -- and maybe falling in love ...
