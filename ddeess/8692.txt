It is the end of World War I. American soldiers Reuben Tarz and Daniel Bishop have both been wounded fighting in the trenches in France. But then the beautiful and sensual Marchioness Michelene Fonsard spirits them from the hospital to her lavish French chateau, opening the door to Reuben's dreams of wealth and power. Reuben and Mickey fall in love and life is idyllic for the three friends--until the arrival of the lovely and spoiled Bebe Rosen unleashes savage passions and desperate deceptions that explode.
