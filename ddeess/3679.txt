"With her independent spirit and youthful determination, Miss Jones is virtually invincible," raved The New York Times Book Review upon meeting Dianne Day's spunky and appealing new heroine in her debut, The Strange Files of Fremont Jones. Now Fremont Jones returns, awakened by a terrible rumbling, and nearly crushed by a falling armoire, to find herself in the midst of the San Francisco Earthquake of 1906. In the confusion and devastation that ensues, Fremont volunteers for the Red Cross, and learns to drive an automobile to transport supplies and handsome doctors, sparking romances along the way. Her sleuthing cohort, the elusive Michael Archer, vanishes, leaving Fremont alone to sleuth the mysteries uncovered by the earthquake and to wrestle with her romantic feelings for Michael. A smuggler's cache unearthed by the disaster leads Fremont straight into danger: kidnapped by murderous Ninjas, Fremont must find her way to safety--thwarted at every turn, as even friends become suspect. Alone Fremont picks her way through the menacing ruins of San Francisco and narrowly escapes with her life.
