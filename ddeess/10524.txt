It's a perfect world, where everything looks right. But ugly truths lie beneath... Imagine a world without poverty, war or pain. A world where everything is comfortable and familiar - a world where everything is the same. No colour, no music. In such a world, Jonas is selected to be the next Receiver of Memory and is apprenticed to the Giver, an old man who stores memories from the Community's past. As Jonas learns about violence and sadness, as well as beauty and joy, he discover the sinister truth behind his safe existence. Simply and beautifully written, The Giver is a thought-provoking look at utopian society. It was awarded the Newbery Medal in 1994.
