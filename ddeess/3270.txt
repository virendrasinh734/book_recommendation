In a vibrant New Mexico art community, a career-driven young teacher is irresistibly drawn to a sexy and mysterious TV star with a dark past. Lauri is a dedicated young teacher for the deaf. Her past conceals a wound still unhealed, her present is a facade, and she uses her career to hide her loneliness. Drake, daytime TV's most popular actor, has two secrets -- the dead wife he can't forget and his daughter Jennifer, a hearing-impaired child who may become a pawn between the man and the woman she needs most. Now, in a chic New Mexico arts community, the three are given a chance to be a family . . . but each of them must find a voice to express the deepest fears and greatest needs of the heart.
