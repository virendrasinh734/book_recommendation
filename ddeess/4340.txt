Destined for a Christmas film release from Columbia Pictures, this heartfelt novel by the co-screenwriter of "Sleepless in Seattle" is about a woman trying to keep her life and her loose-cannon family in order. "Delia Ephron is blessed with the driest of wits, the tenderest of hearts, and an uncanny ear for the way people talk."--Armistead Maupin. The movie will star Meg Ryan and Diane Keaton.
