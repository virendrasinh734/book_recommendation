"Disillusioned with life as a literary publicist in London, as well as with her hotshot, unevolved TV presenter boyfriend, twenty-something Rosie Richardson chucks the glitz and escapes to run a refugee camp in the African desert." "When famine strikes and a massive refugee influx threatens to overwhelm the camp, governments and agencies drag their heels. Calling her media savvy to the fore, and realizing that the only way to get food fast is to bring the celebrities first, Richardson returns to London to organize a star-studded and risky emergency appeal."--BOOK JACKET.Title Summary field provided by Blackwell North America, Inc.
