With annual worldwide sales of over ten million copies, Enid Blyton is one of the most successful and famous writers in the world. But who was the real Enid Blyton? Was it the driving force who wrote 600 books in her 40-year career and yet found time to be a devoted mother and a friend to countless young readers? Or the cold self-absorbed woman described by her younger daughter? Or perhaps a mixture of both? This biography describes her life and background, her two marriages, the development of her career and her writing methods - sitting hunched over a manual typewriter, supported by a plank on her knees, her 'inspiration', style and characterisation. It also deals with the multi-million pound business that the Enid Blyton indusstry has become since her death in 1968.
