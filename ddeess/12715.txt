This "People" magazine "Page Turner of the Week" finds Sally Harrington back in New York, landing her dream job at DBS News in Manhattan. But she's also the key witness in a sensational Hollywood trial. The young journalist then finds a dead body in the trunk of her rental car, a lovesick college intern on her doorstep, a group of crazed assassins hot on her heels--and the Mob on top of everything else.
