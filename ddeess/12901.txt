In a witty and informative way, Vicki Leon profiles 150 women who made their mark around the Mediterranean between 2800 B.C. and 450 A.D.--3,200 years of history from a female vantage point. Among those featured are the Assyrian queen of Babylon who is credited with inventing trousers and the Queen of Kish who began her career as a bar owner. Photos and illustrations.
