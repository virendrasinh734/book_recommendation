Ancient Evenings is a novel by Norman Mailer. It deals with the lives of two protagonists, one young, one old, in a very alien ancient Egypt marked by journeys by the dead, reincarnation, and violent and hyper-sexual gods and mortals in a complex combination of historical fiction, allegory, poetic flight, confession and spiritual meditation. The novel has had an extremely mixed criticial reception marked by a preponderance of negative reviews, some scathing.
