She Dreamed of Finding Mr. Right Margaret "Call me Meg" McKenzie Cooper will do anything to make her children's dreams for a daddy come true-even if it means accepting a stranger's outrageous marriage proposal. Only she hadn't counted on the man's brother being the dangerously sexy Parker Ponthier-or that making her children's dreams come true would mean risking her heart. Could This Dream Come True? Any woman between eight and eighty would kill to flaunt Parker's heirloom diamond engagement ring. The New Orleans millionaire doesn't want someone who's after his bank account-he's looking for a lifetime of love. Meg is warm, passionate, and sets his soul on fire. But while his instincts warn him that she's nothing but trouble with a capital "T," Parker decides that for once in his life he's going to follow his heart.
