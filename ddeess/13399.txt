Beloved author Susan Carroll took the romance world by storm with her captivating novel The Bride Finder, a spellbinding tale of magic, romance, and legend that earned sensational praise from nationally bestselling authors, booksellers, and fans everywhere. Now, in the classic love story Winterbourne, Carroll's exquisite prose and breathless storytelling gift come to life once more--in an irresistible, utterly gripping epic of passion and defiance. ... In the harsh, turbulent Middle Ages, lovely Lady Melyssan remains as she always has been--sweet, timid, and content to be alone. But in a desperate move to resist the advances of the dreaded king, she claims to be married to his worst enemy, Lord Jaufre de Macy, the legendary Dark Knight. Seeking temporary shelter in Jaufre's abandoned castle, Winterbourne, she is unprepared for the fierce, angry warrior who returns to confront her. He is a man as rough and unforgiving as the Welsh border lands he rules--and she is as gentle and innocent as a new day. But neither Jaufre's dark heart nor Melyssan's innocent one can resist the love that is their destiny--nor protect them from the danger drawing ever closer.
