“A master chronicler of our life and times.”—Newsday “A very funny book. . . . If Jane Austen had been crossed with Oscar Wilde and re-crossed with the early Evelyn Waugh, and the result plonked down among the semi-beautiful people of the late 20th-century media-fringe America . . . the outcome might have been something like this.”—Margaret Atwood “Ferociously funny.”—The Los Angeles Times “Beattie’s new novel, her third, is a gratifying surprise. Love Always will be welcomed by the large and loyal Beattie readership, but there is much that recommends it to the previously unconverted.”—Harper’s Bazaar “Beattie’s most comic—indeed her first satiric—work to date. . . . Much of the book’s authenticity derives from the accretion of felt detail—a Beattie trademark. She captures 1984 Vermont with right-on references to Cyndi Lauper, Horchow catalogues, and ‘pre-Cabbage Patch’ Coleco.”—The Christian Science Monitor
