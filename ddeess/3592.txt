From one of America's most beloved funnymen comes a hilarious look at the lighter side of fatherhood. So, what is fatherhood...' It's pretending the present you love most is soap-on-a-rope. It's helping your children learn English as a second language. It's asking your son to make up a name rather than tell anyone who he is. It's knowing that "Everything's okay, Dad!" means "I haven't killed anyone!" It's the book every father will love. It's Bill Cosby at his wittiest, wisest, and warmest. "Bill Cosby makes fatherhood come alive. He takes us on a comedic yet insightful journey through the awesome shifting sands of parenthood. Though this volume is titled Fatherhood, its effect will be to strengthen the entire family." --from the afterword by Alvin F. Poussaint, M.D.
