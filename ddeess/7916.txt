Heaven Lee has come to the Big Easy to get some much-needed vacation time away from her bustling Kansas City restaurant and cook up some dishes worthy of her name for the Sisters of the Holy Trinity's annual benefit diner. But when the Sister's prized crucifix goes missing and a local coffee importer turns us dead, stabbed with Heaven's knife, not only does the famous chef find herself in hot water with the local police, but someone seems to be stalking her as well. Now, embroiled in a mystery as hot as New Orleans' Cajun cooking, heaven must prove her innocence, catch a killer, and whip up some recipes that will save the Sisters from financial ruin before she becomes the main course in a murder trial, or worse yet, ends up as fish food at the bottom of the Mississippi River..
