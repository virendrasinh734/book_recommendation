A Nuala Anne McGrail Novel by the bestselling author of Irish Love Nuala Anne McGrail, the enthralling heroine of Irish Love, returns, along with her devoted husband Dermot, to lend her second sight and irrepressible personality to another savory concoction made up of equal parts of love, humor, and intrigue. You'd think Nuala and Dermot would have enough to worry about, what with their brand-new baby daughter being born three months premature, but Nuala's fey gifts aren't about to go on maternity leave just because little Socra Marie needs more care and loving attention than the average newborn. Soon enough Nuala, and therefore Dermot, find themselves steered toward no less than two unresolved mysteries: Someone is trying to kill Seamus Costelloe, a bigshot lawyer from the South Side of Chicago. Nuala already sees the mark of death upon Seamus. Can she and Dermot somehow find a way to avert her fatal premonition? Equally compelling is the puzzle of Chicago's infamous Haymarket Riot, which may be even harder to solve--given that took place over a century ago!
