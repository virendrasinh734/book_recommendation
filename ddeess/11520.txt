The stunning sequel to Kane & Abel. Florentyna, daughter of a powerful Chicago baron, and Richard, son of a blue-blooded millionaire, were never supposed to meet and fall in love--because their fathers were bitter enemies. This blazing novel spans half a decade and moves from Chicago to New York, Boston to Washington. Previous publisher: Pocket.
