Bill Gates, the chairman, chief executive officer and cofounder of the Microsoft corporation, is the principal architect of the information super-highway that will shape the future. It will affect everyone as well as businesses of every type in ways more pervasive than people recognise. In this book Bill Gates explains the information super-highway, what it is, what it isn't, how individuals and institutions can prepare for it, and how these emerging technologies will transform human existence in unprecedented ways.
