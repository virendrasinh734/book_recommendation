Lady Allegra has made handling unpredictable situations and people an art form, particularly since her father, Oxie Nesbitt, is one of the greatest practical jokers in all of England. For the sinfully handsome and wickedly witty Armand, who loves to observe the world around him, Ally and her outrageous father prove to be too irresistible. He forms a fast friendship with them, enjoying Oxie's pranks and often helping Ally to get him out of his predicaments. But soon both have more than friendship on their minds, in spite of the danger their feelings for one another might bring. When one of Oxie's pranks backfires, and three men are dispatched to take care of him, only Armand and ally can save him--if they put aside their fears of losing themselves to each other.
