After living 14 years with a Stone-Age tribe in the wilds of New Guinea following the crash of his plane, Peter Havistock returns, writes a bestselling book, and embarks on a college tour. Leslie had never seen a doctor of anthropology act the way he does. Peter then goes on a national talk show and announces he's a virgin and looking for a wife--with his eyes set on Leslie. She soon decides there's a first time for everything. Copyright Â© Libri GmbH. All rights reserved.
