"This Newbery Award winning book . . . has been reprinted with a charming reminiscence by the author about her grandmother Caddie . . . Told with style and grace and teamed with . . . fresh new illustrations, the story of Wisconsin frontier life in the 1860s will continue to attract readers today."--"School Library Journal, " starred review.
