Deborah is a woman with personal transportation problems which she and her strange friend Geoffrey intend to solve. If they manage it, the knock-on effect could just save the cities of the world from driving themselves to their own funerals in man's greatest invention. But there are of course those who would be sorry to see that happen, those who are delighted with the traffic jams because they mean more new roads, those who want to see ever more cars sold because they will drink ever more oil, those who applaud only one type of public transport - the gravy train. And so the battle is on: an hilarious, exciting and staggeringly unequal battle in which a traffic warden can be a hero and a wheelchair can turn into a tank.
