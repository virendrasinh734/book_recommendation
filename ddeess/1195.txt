“I don’t care about your conscience. All I want is for you to kiss me again.” Lady Madeline Matthews would rather shame herself than sacrifice her freedom.

Now a forward little minx, completely at sea in London’s sophisticated whirl, is disrupting his life with her vibrant charm and unspoiled beauty. But when what begins with a kiss threatens to blossom into something more rapturous and real, will Logan and Madeline have the courage to drop the masks they hide behind in the name of love?
