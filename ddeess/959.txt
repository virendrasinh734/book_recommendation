For now Talia must ride forth to patrol the kingdom of Valdemar, dispending Herald's justice throughout the land. But in this realm beset by dangerous unrest, enforcing her rulings would require all the courage and skill Talia could commandâ€”for if she misused her own special powers, both she and Valdemar would pay the price!
