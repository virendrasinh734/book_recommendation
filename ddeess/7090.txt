A delightful battle of the sexes as a handsome New Orleans cop tries to charm the shirt off of his lady partner, who refuses to be charmed. Emma Frey is a by–the–book cop in New Orleans, and a case puts her head–to–head with fellow detective Bobby Halloran. Bobby is arrogant and notorious for bending the rules – exactly the type of man Emma avoids. But he also has information about her case and they have no choice but to work together. With an office pool going that Bobby will charm the pants off her in no time flat, Emma is just as determined to keep her pants – and everything else – on. But their case turns out to be more than either of them bargained for.especially when their battle of wills turns into something special.
