FROM THE CRIME TO THE RIDICULOUS From the offbeat but razor-edged imagination of Spider Robinson: Stranded time travelers; cosmic warriors without a war (and others with one); hallucination-eating monsters; blind starship pilots; a tomorrow formed by today's trends -- this Spider weaves a web of wonder. Sound profound? Nah! Herein we've got a partially-disembodied Brooklynite looking for his, er, bottom half, a past-tense-ignoring player of a certain New York crap game from 1930 running loose in the present, a compendium of the silliest weapons history never had, and plenty more. The warped and the way-out combine in a book that by any name would be ... really cool!
