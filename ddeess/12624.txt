The author shares her memories that are by turns hilarious and deeply moving about growing up in the 1950s in Lewiston, New York, a small town near Niagara Falls. As a four-year old, she could read road maps, and made deliveries for her father's pharmacy, including sleeping pills to Marilyn Monroe while she was in town filming "Niagara."
