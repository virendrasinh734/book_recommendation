The inspiration for Andrew Lloyd Webber's iconic musical CATS, and its upcoming movie adaptation, directed by Tom Hooper and starring Taylor Swift (Bombalurina), Idris Elba (Macavity the Mystery Cat), Dame Judi Dench (Old Deuteronomy), Ian McKellen (Gus the Theatre Cat), James Corden (Bustopher Jones), Jennifer Hudson (Grizabella), Jason Derulo (Rum Tum Tugger), and Rebel Wilson (Jennyanydots). Cats Some are sane, and some are mad. Some are good, and some are bad . . . These lovable cat poems were written by T. S. Eliot for his godchildren and continue to delight children and grown-ups. Eliot's beloved cat poems are a curious and artful homage to felines young and old, merry and fierce, small and unmistakably round, and Edward Gorey's graphic interpretations are sure to charm.
