There is a place where your worst fears meet fresh opportunities...and new chances to know love. Suzanne Blume has known success and disappointment in equal measure. A respected lawyer who survived two marriages and put two children through college, she now faces the disquieting prospect of her wayward older daughter moving back home. But more troubling still is the news that is delivered to her at court: Her mother, a woman of legendary independence who has never truly accepted her daughter or approved of her choices, has been felled by age and illness. And, for the first time in her life, she needs Suzanne's help. Intertwining the loves of three generations of contemporary women, master storyteller Marge Piercy brings her exceptional talents to bear on some of the most pressing questions we face today: How do we choose between our own needs and those of the people we love? And how do we overcome our deep resentments and learn to become a family again after years of carving out independent lives?
