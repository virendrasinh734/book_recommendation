It's the 10th Anniversary Edition of Love Is Hell! A book that's been in the making for a solid decade! This medium-sized guide is now available to the public with extra bonus fun-pages never-before-included in previous volumes of the same name! Slightly less scrawny than the original Love Is Hell, this behemoth-style handbook is jam-packed with all the info YOU need to keep your love-fight burnin'! Frankly written and profusely illustrated by famed cartoonist and merchandising monarch Matt Groening, Love Is Hell is the answer to all your Quandaries de l'Amour, or, as we say in American, Love Quandaries. Inside, you'll find handy tips on everything from Getting the Love You Deserve to Getting Your Heart Broken into Millions of Tiny Pieces. Plus so very much more. Why, we've even included a brand-spankin'-new intro by the author himself, written especially for this incredible 10th Anniversary Edition! And as if that wasn't enough, because you've waited so patiently for this special edition to come out, you get a special gold-colored anniversary seal right on the front cover, just because we care. Here's hoping you find a love as lasting and meaningful as this paperback.
