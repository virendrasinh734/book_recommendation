Forty-something homemaker Carolyn Blue is through with cooking and cleaning. She has finally decided to throw in the dishtowel - and take on a dream job as a food writer. Now her plate is filled with exotic locales, delectable foods, and even a dash of crime - to taste. She could very well get used to this . . . Being a professor's wife does have its benefits - the CEO of a large pharmaceutical company has invited Carolyn Blue and her husband to the Big Apple for some serious wining and dining. From miso to matzo, Carolyn is anxious to get a true taste of New York. But before she gets a chance to let the fun go to her head and the food go to her waistline, the CEO is dead - keeled over after a heaping helping of pastrami. Talk about high cholesterol.
