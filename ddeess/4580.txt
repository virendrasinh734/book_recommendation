"Sharyn McCrumb transforms mystery into astonishing literature."--The Cleveland Plain Dealer Forensic anthropologist Elizabeth MacPherson gets a chance to revel in the rites of the old country at the annual Glencoe Mountain Games, the Scottish festival where several hundred like-minded Americans celebrate their ancestors' folkways. But the innocent ethnic fair is cursed when the loathed Colin Campbell is found murdered. Then a second murder silences everyone's bagpipes for good. Enter Elizabeth, who make short work of her search for motive and murderer. "I had a great time at Sharyn McCrumb's inimitable version of the Highland games."--Charlotte MacLeod
