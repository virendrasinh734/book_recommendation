Three things about men: They think dinner comes in a box . . . Claire Willoughby, nationally famous lifestyle diva, knows what it takes to cook luscious meals from scratch, stencil a wall border from a grocery bag, and create beautiful holiday ornaments from common household items. But then her Number One Fan leaves her custody of a small, rambunctious toddler, and suddenly the style goes right out of her life. They never ask for directions . . . And it gets worse. Enter, on a Harley, wearing ragged jeans, a diamond stud earring and a black eye, hell-raiser Ramsey Sage . . . the child's uncle. And though Ramsey claims he wants custody of the little tyke, Claire is plenty certain he doesn't know his way around a nursery. . . . They never admit they're wrong. But she quickly learns he sure knows his way around a woman -- those tempting kisses and scorching gazes turn up the heat hotter than Claire's test kitchen on a summer's day. He seems all wrong for her, but he feels so right. How can it be that Ramsey, despite all his faults, might just be perfect for her?
