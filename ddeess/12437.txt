Dex has made it. A wildly innovative rock star with a conscience and a screw-you persona, his fans adore him for his integrity and his record company love him for his phenomenal record sales. Jay - a music journalist with a reputation for bluntness and a talent for spotting bullshit - is not so convinced. When she meets Dex at a party her main impression is that he could do with a damn good wash. They are both somewhat surprised, therefore, when they fall in love with one another. Several years later and Jay is used to his occasional disappearances, his violent arguments with other band members, his bouts of depression. So when Dex disappears again, she's not too concerned. But when the days turn into weeks, she realises she may never see Dex again, and as the weeks turn into months, she can go no further with her grief. Dex becomes an uncomfortable memory - the dead ex-boyfriend she can't mention to her jealous new lover. Life returns to a series of deadlines and dinner parties. Then Jay hears rumours that Dex has been spotted, and as she is drawn inexorably back into the dark heart of Dex's world, she begins to realise she hardly knew him at all... THIN AIR is a haunting tale of excess, media manipulation and the corruption of fame. It is also a story of escape, innocence rediscovered and the redemptive power of love
