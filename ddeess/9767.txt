“Tolkien devotees will no doubt rejoice. . . . Christopher Tolkien shows himself to be his father’s son, delving into the question of Elvish genealogies. . . . He gives the reader histories of each character’s name as it evolved in the course of Tolkien’s revisions.”—The New York Times Book Review This fascinating second part of The Book of Lost Tales features the tales of Beren and Lúthien, Túrin and the Dragon, and the only full narratives of the Necklace of the Dwarves and the Fall of Gondolin. Essential reading for Middle-earth aficionados, each tale is followed by commentary from editor Christopher Tolkien. Also included is extensive information on the names and vocabulary in the earliest Elvish languages. “The Tales will be appreciated by those who have read The Silmarillion and wish to examine how Tolkien improved his story and style from their original form, and how eventually The Lord of the Rings came to stand independently with only a few hints from the early mythology.”—British Book News
