Because of the Baby: "Lonely men in Hard Luck, Alaska, looking for women. Our town might be cold, but our hearts are warm! Location: north of the Arctic Circle. Population: 150 (mostly men!) But the three O'Halloran brothers, who run a bush-plane charter service called Midnight Sons, are heading a campaign to bring women to town. Matt Caldwell, Charles O'Halloran's brother-in-law, is an easygoing charmer, still in love with his ex-wife. Karen's still in love with him, too. Her reaction to him the night of his sister's wedding certainly proved that. It also left her pregnant. Now Matt wants her to marry him again and not just because of the baby!"--Amazon.
