P.D. Eastman's canine classic—perfect for fans of the Netlix Original Go, Dog. Go! animated preschool series! Written for beginning readers using only 75 different words, this beloved Beginner Book by P.D. Eastman—edited by Dr. Seuss—features all kinds of wonderful dogs riding bicycles, scooters, skiis, roller skates, and driving all sorts of vehicles on their way to a party held on top of a tree! This is a perfect gift for P.D. Eastman fans and dog lovers of all ages! Originally created by Dr. Seuss himself, Beginner Books are fun, funny, and easy to read. These unjacketed hardcover early readers encourage children to read all on their own, using simple words and illustrations. Smaller than the classic large format Seuss picture books like The Lorax and Oh, The Places You'll Go!, these portable packages are perfect for practicing readers ages 3-7, and lucky parents too! "The canine cartoons make an elementary text funny and coherent and still one of the best around."--School Library Journal.
