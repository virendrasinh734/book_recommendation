Readers are invited to three very special weddings under the big country sky. So don't miss these three exciting new stories of love in the great outdoors by three masters of romance. The first to walk down the aisle is young Abby, whose plans to marry Mr. Wrong are interrupted when her childhood sweetheart rides back into town. Next is prim, proper but pregnant Felicity, who resists being wooed by Kirk Conroy, as he is just not daddy material! And finally Sierra, strong and independent, who continues to ignore the constant attention that Dylan McLaine is giving her. But how long can she last?
