Should She Cut And Run...Being left at the altar once was enough for high-powered, workaholic exec Stacey St. Cyr. Stacey's supposed to be on vacation at a posh spa. Instead she's stuck in Doolittle, Arkansas-population next-to-nothing -- watching sexy, small-town pet doctor Michael Halliday work his magic on her colicky collie. And all Stacey can think of is how nice it would be to have Michael's gentle, talented hands on her. ...Or Tie The Knot? This is crazy! He's rural, she's Big City; she's all-business, he's laid back. And if his two young daughters don't warm up to the sexy go-getter, there'll be BIG trouble for this single dad. Still, if he can get Stacey to relax and learn to live a little, perhaps he can follow where his heart is leading him -- and enjoy this tangled, messy, sweet thing called love.
