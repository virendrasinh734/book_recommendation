#1 New York Times bestselling author Sandra Brown has created a sensation with her contemporary novels. In Fanta C she has written a tender, funny, and deeply sensual story about a woman caught between the needs of her children, her career, and her own passionate heart. Elizabeth Burke’s days are filled with the business of running an elegant boutique and caring for her two small children. But her nights are long and empty since the death of her husband two years ago, and she spends them dreaming of the love and romance that might have been. Then Thad Randolph steps into her life—a man right out of her intimate fantasies. Elizabeth, who doesn’t believe in fairy tales and knows all too well that happy endings only happen in books, wishes she could convince herself that friendship is all she wants from Thad. But the day will come when she’ll finally have to make a choice—to remain forever true to her memories or to let go of the past and risk loving once more. “Ms. Brown’s larger-than-life heroes and heroines make you believe all the warm, wonderful, wild things in life.”—Rendezvous
