Bestselling authors Jennifer Blake and Emilie Richards deliver two contemporary stories of family, love, and betrayal, all set against the colorful backdrop of the Deep South. This is their South--filled with old families, old money and old grudges. A place where the finest women are ladies and the best men are gentlemen. And where men from the wrong side of town have more honor than all the blue bloods combined.
