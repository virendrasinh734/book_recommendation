Storytellers know -- just as they have for hundreds and hundreds of years -- that everyone enjoys a good, scary story! Alvin Schwartz's Scary Stories 3 joins his other popular collections of scary folklore, Scary Stories To Tell In The Dark and More Scary Stories To Tell In The Dark, to give readers spooky, funny and fantastic tales guaranteed to raise goose bumps. Who is the Wolf girl? Why is a hearse filled with men with yellow glowing eyes? Can a nightmare become reality? How do you avoid an appointment with Death? Stephen Gammell's splendidly creepy drawings perfectly capture the mood of more than two dozens scary stories -- and even a scary song -- all just right for reading along or for telling aloud in the dark..
