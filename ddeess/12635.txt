"Michaelangelo is an unusual killer, a man tortured by a painful past, mesmerized by a bizarre artistic vision, who believes he is an artist of transcendent and consummate talent. The FBI, frantic to discover something about his motives after he strikes at a small-town post office in upstate New York, assigns Ariel Grace to its task force. When Ariel sees the security video taken at the crime scene, she is convinced she's found the twisted logic behind his rage: his all-consuming shame at appearing at number ten on the FBI's Ten Most Wanted List." "Unknown to either Michaelangelo or Grace, a deep-undercover FBI agent is posing as criminal number five, and he appears next in Michaelangelo's sights. Once the chase ensues and Grace learns she is the only one who can save her fellow agent, all three become desperate to catch their quarry before they are caught themselves."--BOOK JACKET.Title Summary field provided by Blackwell North America, Inc.
