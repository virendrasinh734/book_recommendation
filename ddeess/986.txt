When Bobby Spencer finds a carousel horse and an armed guard in his front yard, he's the talk of Trinity Harbor, Virginia. Urban planner Jenna Pennington Kennedy was desperate to capture Bobby's attention and convince him to offer her the chance to plan the town's new riverfront development. The stubborn and all-too-sexy property owner doesn't want a single mom in his life, but love has a way of defying expectations. Copyright Â© Libri GmbH. All rights reserved.
