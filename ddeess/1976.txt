Jake Carpenter has traveled all over the wold, living a neat, orderly life. Now he's come to Paradise Beach, Florida, intending to stop his globetrotting ways and settle down with a tidy woman. But barging into his life comes untidy, disorderly Rainbow Moonglow. The sexy psychic turns Jake's world upside down, gets him all shook up in more ways than one. And suddenly - surprisingly - he's having the time of his life.But Jake knows that he and Rainbow are worlds apart. His soul-searing desire for this eminently kissable woman defies all rational behavior, but rational is the last thing he feels when he takes Rainbow in his arms. She's as tempting as a summer breeze yet as unpredictable as the weather. And soon he realizes he can never let her go...even if it means chasing Rainbow from here to eternity.
