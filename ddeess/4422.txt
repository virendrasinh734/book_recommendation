The trouble with men... Eve Van Dormer can't believe it — the beautiful, brainy millionaire's daughter is stuck with Wyatt Culver as her bodyguard, thanks to her over-reactive father. She's doubly shocked at the choice too — after all, dear old Dad once tossed Wyatt's rather attractive backside out of her life. As for attending their class reunion ... what's the most dangerous thing that could happen — assault with a deadly yearbook? Besides, Wyatt's strong, quiet sensuality is making Eve quickly realize that her body definitely needs guarding — from his! Is that they're trouble! Protecting Eve is a job Wyat can handle, but what's happened to the Eve he once knew, a woman filled with teasing laughter who'd do anything for a stolen kiss with him? Wyatt has his instructions — keep her ex-husband away and keep her happy — but he knows Eve will be happy only when she allows passion back into her life...so how can he convince her that he's the man for the job?
