Ramses II, the Son of the Light, is about to reach his coronation. He has all he should need to become a great pharaoh: his wife Nefertari and his mother both love him unconditionally, and he enjoys great strength from solid friendships formed in childhood, especially that of the Hebrew Moses. And yet still the young pharaoh must fight to hold on to the throne. For lurking all around in the shadows are new conspiracies against him. Will he succeed in avoiding the traps set in his path by his older brother? Can he avert the black magic of a mysterious sorcerer and ward off the schemes of the Hittites? The ambushes accumulate and Ramses' defences are exhausted. To vanquish their enemies, visible and unseen, the royal couple resort to the only possible course of action - they build a Temple of a Million Years.
