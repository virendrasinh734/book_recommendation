Christopher Rice became a publishing sensation over-- -night with his rst novel, A Density of Souls. With the publi-cation of his second novel, The Snow Garden- an instant New York Times best-seller-he has established himself as one of the most original writers of a new gener-ation. The Snow Garden is a story of murder and sexual menace on a snowbound university campus. When a respected professor's wife drives to her death in an icy river, an illicit relationship between a student and his teacher threatens to come to light, and within days Atherton University is the scene of escalating speculation and intrigue. Another death emerges from the shadows, and the connections between the two accidents begin to look uncomfortably close. Rice explores the dynamic within a tightly knit group of young people haunted by sexual memories and fears and driven by obscure desires. The Snow Garden casts this web of friendship and passion against the backdrop of a threat that grows darker as the novel proceeds. The result is a stunning novel from an arresting talent. Christopher Rice is the best-selling author of A Density of Souls and son of novelist Anne Rice and poet and artist Stan Rice. He lives in Los Angeles.
