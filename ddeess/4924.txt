Focuses on the decisions, public and private, that shape women's lives. Inspired by the title poem in which an older woman looks back on a life sensibly lived and wishes she had 'eaten more ice cream and less beans', anthologist Sandra Martz captures the experiences of women, young and old, as they make choices that form the tapestry of their lives. Some of the writers speak of lost opportunities, but more often than not these women proclaim a sense of satisfaction with their lives and would not change a single breathless moment.
