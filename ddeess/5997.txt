Jolene Hadley Corbett believes that on a bad hair day bad things happen – men run off, cars break down, it rains all over your best new outfit. So when Ry O'Malley comes back into town Jolene immediately checks the mirror. Yep, bad hair! Jolene Hadley Corbett believes that on a bad hair day bad things happen–men run off, cars break down, it rains all over your best new outfit. So when Ry O'Malley comes back into town Jolene immediately checks the mirror. Yep, bad hair! Of course, there's also that generations old Corbett/O'Malley feud––sort of like a poor man's Hatfield/McCoy feud. It's the biggest tourist draw in Verbena, Georgia––bigger than the AE Hadley Auto Garage and Museum...huger than the Every Other Sunday Flea Market and Jamboree...more monster than the Southwinds Trav'O'Tel and All Day Breakfast Buffet (the cause of indigestion in three counties!) Jolene's not about to let a man who once pulled off the top of her bathing suit (OK she was 14 and in the pool...but still!) get away with messing up her well–conditioned world. So she gears up for the final chapter in the O'Malley–Hadley feud. She expects to win...But first, she's got to find that can of hairspray.
