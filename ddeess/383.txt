Two men, a street-smart NYPD detective and a pioneering brain surgeon, are separated by race and mistrust, but are united in their love for one woman. When a madman's act of violence leaves a victim comatose, the men are forced to combine their efforts and their minds in a radical untested procedure that crosses the line between life and death.
