Harry Silver has it all: a beautiful wife, a wonderful son, a great job in the media--but in one night he throws it all away. Just yesterday Harry gave himself a shiny red sports car for his thirtieth birthday. Today he faces the baffling questions of a suddenly single dad: --How do you wash a four-year-old's hair? --Should he eat green spaghetti for breakfast? --What do you tell his Mommy from the emergency room phone? Harry has to bring up his child alone, look after his parents, work out his relationships and hold down a job. As millions of women have discovered before him, that is not as simple as it may have seemed.
