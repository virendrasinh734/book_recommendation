In Vatican City, a lone priest climbs to the top of St. Peter's Basilica and mysteriously falls to his death. The new pope, an audacious risk-taker, and Brother Paul begin to investigate. But even as the veils are drawn back on the truth, the two men are shadowed by long-hidden ghosts. "Fast-paced and wildly entertaining."
