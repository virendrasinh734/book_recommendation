She is a sorceress -- indescribably beautiful, overpoweringly sensual -- who possesses incomprehensible powers. She is also a murderess who plans to use her power to kill Nicholas Linnear, the hero of The Ninja.This is only the beginning of this exotic thriller, which raises the Oriental worlds of honor and death to new levels of terror and sensuality. Lustbader weaves an utterly compelling tale of the CIA, the KGB, the technological world of modern Japan, and the mystical and dangerous realms of Ninja warriors. Copyright Â© Libri GmbH.
