Four holiday hits from four of the genre's favorite authors! "Merry, Merry" by Fern Michaels features a veterinarian who figures her holidays are going to the dogs--until she meets a handsome stranger; in "A Vision of Sugar Plums" by Jennifer Blake, Meghan Castle is a real Scrooge about the holidays--until she discovers an abandoned baby in her store on Christmas Eve and a chance at romance; in Hannah Howell's "The Yuletide Gift", a young woman flees an arranged marriage and finds shelter and love in the home of a Scottish laird; and Olga Bico's "Naughty or Nice" finds a nervous bride-to-be trapped overnight in an elevator on Christmas Eve with a handsome department store Santa she can't resist.
