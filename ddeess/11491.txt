Sometimes weird things happen. Just ask Cassie, Jake, Marco, Rachel, and Tobias. One night they spot a strange light in the sky. Soon they are face to face with an alien from another planet who informs them that the Earth is being invaded by evil Yeerks, and gives them a special power to fight back: the ability to morph into any animal they desire. It is now up to them to save the planet! Text copyright 2004 Lectorum Publications, Inc.
