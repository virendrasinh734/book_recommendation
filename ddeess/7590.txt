James Finn Garner wowed the world when he wrote Politically Correct Bedtime Stories, which sold nearly 2 million copies, and then followed it up with two books with the same theme, Politically Correct Holiday Stories and Once Upon An Enlightened Time; the three books together sold nearly 3.5 million copies in the U.S. and were translated into 20 languages. Garner's incisive and hilarious books took age-old bedtime and holiday stories and made them into politically correct tales of our day. His original humor, filled with social commentary, is well-known by readers around the country -- most recently in his new book Apocalypse Wow!
