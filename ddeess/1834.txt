Shaken by a painful divorce, successful television writer Debra Barry leaves New York for the beautiful countryside of New Hampshire, where she hopes to find peace and solitude to mend her wounded heart. The old house she's bought, though, needs as much repairing as her own shattered emotions. To make it the home she's always wanted, she seeks the help of master cerpenter Graham Reid, a compellingly enigmatic man seemingly as hard as granite itself. Hiding from his own bitter past, Graham reluctantly agrees to take the job, not suspecting that his own life is about to be altered as well. As the house begins to come together, he and Debra unexpectedly find themselves laying their own emotional groundwork. Drawn together by desire, can these two wounded lovers find the courage to tear down the walls between them and build on the promise of new love?
