In this beguiling new novel, Iris Rainer Dart again captivates readers with the same blend of poignancy, humor, and humanity that made us laugh and cry in her novel Beaches. Lily Benjamin is a funny, fiesty TV comedy writer juggling the problems of a demanding job, single motherhood, and a romantic relationship with a successful cardiologist. When the head writer on her show dies suddenly, an A-list writer named Charlie Roth is hired to come in to save the show. The man is tough, hilarious, and an incurable curmudgeon with terrible problems. But when tragedy strikes Lily and her son, Charlie's gruff exterior crumbles, revealing the kind, sensitive spirit of a man who understands their pain in a way no one else can. And as he helps the mother and son rebuild their world, something magical and unexpected happens. The delicious surprise of how these three change one another's lives will make readers laugh through their tears.
