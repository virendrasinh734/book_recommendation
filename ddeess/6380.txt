To unify her family, Ave Maria must harness the power of love and its abiding truth in this lyrical and heartfelt novel, the third installment of the New York Times bestselling Big Stone Gap series “Trigiani can make you laugh in one sentence then break your heart in the next.”—Mississippi Clarion-Ledger Ave Maria Mulligan MacChesney has never been a devotee of tarot cards or crystal balls. And yet when the fortune-teller at the county fair suggests that it is time for her to “redream” her life, Ave Maria realizes she is wide open to suggestion. Not a bad idea considering that her beloved daughter, Etta, is growing up fast. In the face of the trials of adolescence, Ave Maria tries to prepare herself for the day when Etta will rebel big-time. Of course, everyone in Big Stone Gap sees it’s coming: Cranky cashier Fleeta has warned her, county sexpert Iva Lou has consoled her, even Pearl, now a mother herself, has lent her sympathy—but that doesn’t make the changes in Etta any easier to handle. Milk Glass Moon chronicles the challenges Ave Maria faces in her parenting and in her marriage, with more surprising twists and turns than on the mountain roads of southwest Virginia.
