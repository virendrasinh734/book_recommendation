Aphrodite's Girdle is missing, and Hale knows it will take all of his superpowers to retrieve it. The mortal who wears it--the plain Tracy Tannin--is now as irresistible to men as her grandmother, a goddess of the silver screen, once was. Every man wants her, including the immortal Hale, who wants to convince Tracy she is as desirable as he sees her. Copyright Â© Libri GmbH. All rights reserved.
