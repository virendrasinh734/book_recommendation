From Booklist The third installment in Macomber's absorbing Cedar Cove series (following 204 Rosewood Lane [BKL S 15 02]) focuses on Rosie and Zach Cox, who have divorced after 17 years of marriage. They are shocked when Judge Olivia Lockhart makes another of her controversial rulings, this time granting their kids the house and ordering Rosie and Zach to make alternating visits. As they struggle with their tiring schedule and deal with their 15-year-old daughter Allison's growing resentment and subsequent problems, they realize that they still care for each other. Then, when Allison and her 9-year-old brother, plot to get their parents back together Rosie and Zach contemplate a reunion but know that learning to trust each other again will take some time. Meanwhile, Olivia is dealing with a love triangle; widowed librarian Grace explores the world of dating via the Internet; and Grace's daughter, Maryellen, struggles with being a first-time mom. Excellent characterization will keep readers anticipating the next visit to Cedar Cove. Megan Kalan Copyright Â© American Library Association.
