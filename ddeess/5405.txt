A woman’s quest for courage opens her heart to love in the third Key Trilogy novel from #1 New York Times bestselling author Nora Roberts. Growing up, Zoe McCourt did not have an easy life—some might call it “disadvantaged.” A hairstylist from a West Virginia trailer park, she ended up in beautiful Pleasant Valley, Pennsylvania, by sheer determination. How she ended up on a quest for a key to unlock the soul of a warrior demigoddess is another story… Invited to an imposing estate overlooking the town, she met Malory Price and Dana Steele. Each woman was at a crossroads in her life, each facing an uncertain future. And a mysterious couple offered them the chance of a lifetime: a million dollars each if they could free the trapped souls of three mythological sisters—an artist, a bard, and a warrior. Malory and Dana had to reach deep inside themselves to find their keys—and not without paying a price. Now, it has become Zoe’s quest. As a single mother, she has more to risk, more to lose. But her courage in the face of overwhelming odds cannot be underestimated. A nurturer to her son, a defender of her friends, she must confront dark forces amassed against her to make all of their dreams come true… Don’t miss the other books in the Key Trilogy Key of Light Key of Knowledge
