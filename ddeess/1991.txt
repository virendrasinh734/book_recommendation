Wearing poppies on your lapel during the month of November. Enjoying local fiddlers playing music on Cape Breton Island. Cheering your favorite team on during Hockey Night. Swatting mosquitoes in Muskoka on the first long weekend in May. Driving the Trans-Canada Highway. Questioning why the ABC song ends in "z" and not "zed." All these things are distinctly Canadian and now there's another one more: Chicken Soup for the Canadian Soul. Written by fellow Canadians from Cape Breton Island to Prince Edward Island, from Montreal to Vancouver, this book reveals the people, the history and the special moments that give Canada such a distinctive charm and character. With chapters including: On Being Canadian, Living Your Dream, Overcoming Obstacles, On Love, On Kindness and Making a Difference, these stories weave a rich tapestry of life from the people who call Canada home. Notable stories include: hockey player Paul Henderson's "Goal of the Century"; Chief Dan George's recounting of his great land; Marilyn Bell DiLascio's historic 1954 Lake Ontario swim; cartoonist Lynn Johnston's delightful story of an encounter with Wayne Gretzky; and journalist Sally Armstrong's details of Princess Diana's first trip to Canada. Like hearing a heartfelt version of "O, Canada!", this book will instill renewed pride and patriotism in a well-deserving country and its people.
