Forensic anthropologist Temperance Brennan returns in this follow-up to the bestselling "Deja Dead". This time, Brennan digs for a corpse where a nun who died a century ago should be lying in her grave. Sister Elizabeth Nicolet's life and death provides a welcome contrast to discoveries at a burning chalet, where scorched bodies are found.
