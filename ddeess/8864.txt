An English Gothic mansion, transported stone by stone to the isolated Pennsylvania hills, Grayhaven Manor calls to Anne and Kevin. Here is the ideal summer retreat-a perfect location from which to write the book they have long planned together. But there are distractions in the halls and shadows of the looming architectural wonder luring them from their work-for they are not alone. Something lives on here from Grayhaven's shocking past-something beautiful, powerful, and eerily seductive-unlocking the doors of human desire, of fear ... and unearthly passion.
