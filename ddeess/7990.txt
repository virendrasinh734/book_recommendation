Carolyn Hart's ex-reporter sleuth, Henrietta "Henrie 0" O'Dwyer Collins, joins a wedding party in glorious Bermuda -- only to discover that death is an uninvited guest. Resort To Murder Retired Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Henrietta Collins no longer races around the globe in pursuit of news. But her talent for troubleshooting and her zest for life are much needed at a family gathering in sunny Bermuda, where murder prowls the halls of a luxury hotel. Henrie 0 has come to the island with her grandchildren for the remarriage of their father, Lloyd Drake. Henrie O's former son-in-law plans to marry Connor Bailey, a beautiful widow with a dark past and a knack for attracting men. Only a year earlier, the resort manager's husband fell from a tower to his death after quarreling with Connor. And now it seems that his restless spirit is haunting the hotel -- and perhaps seeking revenge. Henrie 0 has no patience for bogus supernatural appearances, no matter how artfully done. But when she sets out to unmask the "ghost's" creator, she soon realizes there's much more at stake. A second death -- a fatal fall from a cliff -- makes it clear to Henrie 0 that great evil is afoot in this elegant enclave kissed by warm turquoise water, glistening pink sands, and balmy ocean breezes. With everyone connected with the once-joyous planned union of Lloyd and Connor now both a suspect and a potential target of a fiendishly relentless killer, Henrie 0 is gravely concerned for the well-being of her loved ones. It is more than motivation enough for the accomplished amateur sleuth to take investigative matters into her own able hands despite the risks. Decades of experience have taught her that there are some lethal secrets that haunt both the innocent and the guilty alike, vengeful spirits who will not rest until some terrible blood debt has been repaid in full.
