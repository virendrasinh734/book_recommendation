From the author of the prize-winning "Snow Falling on Cedars" comes a novel of America. Diagnosed with terminal cancer, a recently widowed, retired heart surgeon, accompanied by his two dogs, sets out on a journey through the mythic West--sage deserts, yawning canyons, dusty ranches, and vast orchards--on his last hunt.
