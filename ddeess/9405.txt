Love is often a mystery to teenagers — sometimes painful, other times glorious, always challenging. This book will help them understand and sort out their myriad feelings and experiences. Rather than merely offering one adult’s opinions or reflections on love, Kirberger deftly combines material from teens dealing with firsthand adolescent love with that from adults sensitive to the special needs of teens. She includes original letters she has received from teens, along with her responses to their questions, concerns and confusion. This blend provides a wide-ranging perspective on love and relationships. It will enable teens to gain wisdom and choose more wisely when making decisions in love and relationships. This book is designed to guide teens through the maze of love and relationships in a gentle, understanding and compassionate way. It isn’t a dos-and-don’ts manual, but rather a how-it-is-in-love guidebook. Teens will come to treasure it as a wise and loving counselor and companion. On the roller-coaster ride of teen love, this is one book no teen can afford to be without. Check out the companion book, , co-authored with Colin Mortensen of MTV’s Real World/Hawaii.
