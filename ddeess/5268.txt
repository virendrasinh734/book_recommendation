"Brilliant...Perhaps no other piece of fiction since SHOGUN illuminates the mind, machinations, and mores of Eastern peoles with the style and intensity of JIAN." THE MIAMI HERALD Jake Maroc is the top agent for the Quarry, the secretive government agency. Nichiren, Jake's sworn enemy, is a cold killer with a deadly secret. Shi Zilin is a wily Communist minister, a survivor of eras in turmoil. Which one of them will emerge the true Jian--the consummate warrior, the man who excels, the supreme master of the arts of love and combat, strength and wisdom? Four ancient pieces of jade are the key to unlocking the grand scheme of the Jian. The price is Hong Kong--glittering jewel that sets the KGB, the Communist Chinese, and the Americans in a deadly battle.
