In The Clairvoyant Countess, the bestselling author of the beloved Mrs. Pollifax series gives us the mysterious Madame Karitska, who can see things no one else can—including murder. Madame Karitska has a style all her own—a rare blend of psychic power, an exotic past, and an uncanny gift for common sense. But when a chance encounter with Detective-Lieutenant Pruden of the Police Department catapults her into the midst of a seamier side of life, she must use all her resources to keep danger at bay. “Dorothy Gilman is one of those authors that we would like to lock in a tower and command to produce a novel at least every three months. To get a new one is to become ecstatic, to finish it is to grieve, and to wait for the next one is torment!”—Chattanooga Times
