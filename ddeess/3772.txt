Aussie Madeline Wolfe has left her home, her surfboard and her hemisphere for the new man in her life. Alexander Drake, indisputed King of the TV jungle, gives the best cunnilingus this side of a detachable shower nozzle. He's also the kind of bloke who goes through the Tunnel of Love holding his own hand. By the time Maddy discovers that it's not just Alex's feet but his entire body that's made of clay, she's taken a pregnancy test . . . and failed. Will Alex chicken out of his obligation to his egg?
