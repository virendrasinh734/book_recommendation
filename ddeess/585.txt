Evocative, suspenseful, and beautifully written, this debut women's thriller is set in a town called Train Line, in western-most New York, home to a community of mediums and spiritualists. In this environment, Naomi Ash comes of age and begins to distinguish what might be her own true vision from fakery and fraud.
