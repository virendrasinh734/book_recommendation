From the #1 New York Times bestselling author of the Penn Cage series comes a heartstopping thriller about one of the great unsolved mysteries of World War II. The Spandau Diary—what was in it? Why did the secret intelligence agencies of every major power want it? Why was a brave and beautiful woman kidnapped and sexually tormented to get it? Why did a chain of deception and violent death lash out across the globe, from survivors of the Nazi past to warriors in the new conflict now about to explode? Why did the world’s entire history of World War II have to be rewritten as the future hung over a nightmare abyss? “Entirely plausible, totally engrossing…a remarkable, impressive novel.”—Nelson DeMille “An incredible web of intrigue and suspense, an avalanche of action from first page to last.”—Clive Cussler
