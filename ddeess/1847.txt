From the author of Wiseguy (made into the movie Goodfellas), comes this tale of love, marriage, adultery, murder, and revenge mafia-style. Both a love story and a bigger-than-life business story, Casino exposes the secrets of Las Vegas's multibillion-dollar casino gambling industry--and how the mob finally lost its stranglehold over it.
