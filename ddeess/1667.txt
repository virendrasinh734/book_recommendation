This brand-new story based on Foster's series about the Buckhorn County brothers is the much-demanded tale of Sawyer's son, Casey. Emma Clark was a teen with a bad reputation and tried everything to get Casey Hudson into bed. It was hard for a teenage Casey to resist Emma. Now, eight years later, it's impossible and Casey must convince Emma the attraction is more than leftover teenage lust. Original.
