Who's your satellite sister? She's the one you turn to when the best thing in your life happens-or the worst. She's a satellite sister, a friend or sibling or college roommate who supports, accepts, sometimes busts, and always encourages you. She can get you through a bad haircut-or a bad marriage. And, because nothing beats old-fashioned hilarity, your satellite sister makes you laugh so hard that Diet Coke comes out your nose. Meet the Satellite Sisters: Five real-life sisters who grew up, grew apart, and then came together again, united by the belief that whether by nature or by choice, being someone's sister or friend is what gives meaning to our lives. In Satellite Sisters' UnCommon Senses, the Dolan sisters apply their big-family wisdom to the range of experiences and issues we face in our grown-up lives. The result is their UnCommon Senses-5 essential traits needed to face the challenges and demands of our over-subscribed modern lives...and still end the day with our laughter intact. Warm, spirited, wise, and hilarious, these Satellite Sisters will remind you of your own satellite sisters.
