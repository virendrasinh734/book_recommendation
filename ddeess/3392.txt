With Clive Barker's trademark mingling of wild fantasy, eroticism, and visionary horror, Everville promises a journey that will awe, arouse, and terrify in equal measure, opening the doors of a new reality--a strange and sensual wonderland of magical possibility. Enthralling and chilling, this is a novel about the deepest yearnings of the human heart. And about monsters that are never more terrible than when they wear human faces. Step onto Everville's streets and enter a world like no other in fiction. A world only Clive Barker could create.
