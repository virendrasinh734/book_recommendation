“A vigorous tale of twists and turns . . . An authentic thriller.”—The Washington Post Book World Murder didn't stop Mac Smith or Annabel Reed from falling in love, or from getting married at the glorious church on the hill in Washington, D.C., the National Cathedral. But the brutal murder of a friend drags them from their newlywed bliss into an unholy web of intrigue and danger. The body is found in the cathedral. There are scant clues and no suspects. And to further complicate matters, a parallel crime is committed at a church in England's Cotswolds, where the honeymooners have recently been visitors. Across the sea go the Smiths again, and straight into the center of an ungodly plot of secret agents, a playboy priest, a frustrated lover, a choleric cleric . . . and a murder so perfect it's a sin. Praise for Murder at the National Cathedral “One of her most enjoyable books.”—Associated Press “Margaret Truman has become a first-rate mystery writer.”—Los Angeles Times Book Review
