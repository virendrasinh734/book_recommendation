'Tis the season for passion and intrigue in these four festive Christmas novellas by four outstanding authors—including a Lieutenant Eve Dallas story from #1 New York Times bestselling author J. D. Robb. In J. D. Robb's "Midnight in Death," Lieutenant Eve Dallas must postpone her first Christmas with her new husband, Roarke, to hunt for an escaped serial killer—but she and Roarke still manage to find ways to celebrate. Susan Plunkett's "Christmas Promises" brings a woman and her ex-fiance together after four long years as they search for a missing child—and make up for the broken promises of Christmases past. In Dee Holmes's "The Unexpected Gift," Sabrina McKay and her five-year-old son are coping with the first Christmas since her divorce when her son finds a "body" in the yard—and unexpectedly they rediscover the true spirit of the holidays. In Claire Cross's "A Berry Merry Christmas," a mysterious nanny has a special message to deliver to a young orphan and her uncle who long to feel the joy of Christmas in their hearts once again.
