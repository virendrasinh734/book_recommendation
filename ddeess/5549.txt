Covey's new book shows how the 7 habits have touched the lives of millions. The people, institutions, companies and even governments that have incorporated the principles of the 7 habits into their lives are profiled for their achievements in LIVING THE 7 HABITS.

From running a corporation to trying to improve the quality of the individual's life, Covey's new book will offer vital examples of people whose success is grounded in the 7 habits. An indispensable book for millions.
