It began with a chance meeting and led to a date at a small French restaurant in a city by the sea. She ordered expensive wine. He paid the bill. She spoke of the sea. He was haunted by her green eyes and copper-colored skin. Then, in a matter of weeks, the woman named Cricket Page would lead Wilson Lander away from the moorings of his familiar life, away from his relationship with a successful businesswoman and onto a tycoon's yacht called the Compound Interest--for a journey across the great Sargasso Sea. Coming ashore in a world of searing mystery and danger, Lander will pay the price for his unquenchable desire for Cricket Page, for their moments of stolen pleasure and her cryptic promises of a life of luxury together. For she is a pirate's daughter, and in an exotic land exploding with cruelty and violence, populated by maniacs and plunderers, Wilson Lander must escape the woman who has stolen his heart--and given him his freedom. . . .
