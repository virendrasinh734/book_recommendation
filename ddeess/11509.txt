"I will wed only my one true love " declared Princess Brianna despite King Henry's decree that she marry one of the sons of the man who had conquered her family's castle. So Brianna issued a seemingly impossible challenge: He who returned with a gift that made her laugh would win her hand. And thus began the bride quest of the three brothers Fitzgavin. . . . Burke and Rowan, knights both, set out at her command. Only Luc remained, refusing to indulge the whims of the glorious Irish princess. Even Brianna's legendary beauty could not tempt him--until she invaded his senses . . . and his soul. But Luc thought a princess had no place in the life of a battle-weary warrior who vowed to lay down his sword forever--until he was forced to take up arms to protect the fair maiden who had seized his heart by divine right.
