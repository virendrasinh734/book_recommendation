Courtney Von Dragen Smith has done the unthinkable: In a burst of self-improving zeal (and some unexpected trouble with local options), she has left home for college out of state. What seemed like a good idea in spring feels like a calamity in fall. Culture in rural Wisconsin seems to be a formal bratwurst roast. Not to mention: Grant (best bf ever) is 1,000 miles away, there's a six-foot ear of corn making unwanted advances, and being vegan in America's Dairyland is regarded as highly suspicous at best. And so Courtney, "so on the fringe," begins her chronicle of what truly is a Wurst Case Scenario.
