The Dragon Lord has no desire to wed, but the landless knight has no choice to obey his king. Of the three women offered to him, he chooses the meek virgin. But she longs for a cloistered life in a nunnery, while her sister, Rose, is quite capable of standing up to a dragon. A clever deception would allow Rose's sister to enter the nunnery, while an unsuspecting bride awaits her unsuspecting husband.
