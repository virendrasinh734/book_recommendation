The northwoods town of Tall Pine, Minnesota, is home to a collection of characters only novelist Lorna Landvik could have created. And they all hang out at the Cup O'Delight cafe, where Lee O'Leary serves up good food and heavenly coffee with a lot of heart. The most excitement this quaint, quirky paradise sees is when the locals gather for the inspirational evenings they call the Tall Pine Polka. But things really start jumping when a Hollywood movie crew rolls into town -- and zooms in on Lee's best friend, Fenny Ness, to star in the romantic comedy they're shooting. It's just the shot in the arm the melancholy young woman needs, until an itinerant musician named Big Bill comes along and shoots her in the heart with Cupid's arrow. The trouble is, Lee's also bewitched by Big Bill ... and the triangle will test her and Fenny's friendship in ways neither could imagine.
