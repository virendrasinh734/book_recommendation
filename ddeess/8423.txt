Jane Whittaker has awakened to a nightmare. She doesn't know her name, her age . . .or even what she looks like. Frightened and confused, she wanders the streets of Boston wearing a blood-soaked dress-and carrying $10,000 in her pocket. Her life has become a vacuum--her past vanished. . .or stolen. And all that remains is a handsome, unsettling stranger who claims to be her husband, whispered rumors about a dead child whom she cannot recall. . .and a terrifying premonition that something truly horrible is about to occur.
