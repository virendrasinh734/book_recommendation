From the bestselling author of The Handmaid's Tale and The Testaments • By turns satiric, thrilling, and terrifying, Bodily Harm charts the dark currents of the lust for power—both sexual and political—as it builds to a devastating climax. Rennie Wilford is a journalist who writes about the latest trends and considers herself an expert on the superficial surfaces of life. When her own life takes a dark turn, she seeks to recuperate by flying to the Caribbean to research a fluffy travel piece. But her carelessly chosen destination, the tiny island of St. Antoine, is on the verge of a violent revolution and Rennie soon finds herself ensnared in a world of corruption and treachery and unsure whom to trust.
