Mirabeau, Texas, is a dynamite little town -- especially when toolsheds, doghouses, and mailboxes mysteriously begin to explode. So far, the sole victim is local librarian Jordan Poteet, struck by a chunk of his girlfriend's mailbox. Yet Jordy gets an even bigger jolt when his ex-girlfriend, Lorna, arrives from Boston. She's come to scoop up everybody's riverfront property -- and, if possible, Jordy as well. With pro-development folk and die-hard environmentalists all foaming at the mouth, tempers become downright murderous. And the unfortunate victim is Lorna's handsome colleague, garroted with a piece of barbed wire at the Mirabeau B&B. Dynamite, lust, murder...what next? Mirabeau braces for the worst and gets it -- while Jordy, his true love Candace, and Police Chief Junebug Moncrief light out after a killer... Agatha Award-winning author of Do Unto Others.
