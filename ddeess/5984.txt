Southhampton is a place of casual elegance and simple perfection. Where the rich watch each other grow richer, and the whispers of scandal are as relentless as the rhythm of the sea. Here three beautiful, lonely women--Julia, Diana, and Casey--struggle to find love--or save it. Each is driven by her own fears, desires, dearest dreams and a haunting hope of a life of love.
