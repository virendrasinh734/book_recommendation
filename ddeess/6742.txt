Abigail Lee, the beautiful assistant to Harrison Montgomery, walks into Ethan Maddux's law office. With obvious attraction, Ethan wonders what she could possibly be doing in here. But when Abigail tells him that Harrison is in trouble, and needs his help, what is Ethan suppose to do? Ethan hasn't talked to his father in years nor does he want to, and so he definitely doesn't want to help him save his business. Will this woman convince Ethan to help his father, salvage their relationship, and maybe create a new one of her own?
