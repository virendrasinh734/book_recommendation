"The good people of Moose County are in a fever of excitement. Not only is the gala groundbreaking for the new Pickax bookstore about to take place, but the town of Brrr is preparing to celebrate its bicentennial, and columnist James Qwilleran has been roped in to help with the festivities." "The groundbreaking, however, is marred by the discovery of a man's body nearby - on Qwill's own property, no less. Could it be the work of the killer who used the same MO in northern Michigan? And why does Qwill's sage Siamese, Koko, keep insisting that his human read him a book that Qwill can't stand? Then there's the sudden appearance of what seem to be wild turkeys, which haven't been present in Moose County for thirty years. Could Qwill be hallucinating?"--BOOK JACKET.
