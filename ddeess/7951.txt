'[A] brilliant novel...at its centre is a real-life encounter that occurred at Craiglockhart in 1917 between W.H.R. Rivers, an army psychologist, and Siegfried Sassoon...Intense and subtle, getting responsively under the skin of both real and imagined characters, Regeneration is receptive to all aspects of the era - and the heroes - it resurrects' Peter Kemp, Sunday Times
