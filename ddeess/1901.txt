Dear Santa: I desperately need a new computer so I can talk to other cats on the Internet. OK, it's my fault the old one doesn't work. I honestly thought the mouse was a toy so I kind of batted it around. By the time I realized the fish was a screensaver, the monitor was pretty scratched. Sincerely, Einstein Two, Cat Feisty felines making very specific Christmas demands: what could be funnier or more appealing to cat lovers? Delightfully illustrated with drawings throughout, this whimsical collection of letters to Santa reveals, for the first time, what kitty just can't do without. From the pretend--innocent pleas of Screwball, who asks for a dozen playmates for the family fish whose companion has "mysteriously disappeared," to the tired scrawl of Sleepy, who wants more naptimes during the day, each note is full of fun.
