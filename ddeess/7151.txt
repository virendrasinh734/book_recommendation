For someone as innocent and fragile as Brianna, Pierce is too jaded and grief stricken to do anything but hurt her. Yet somehow she has eased his pain with her sweet caring and somehow he has resisted taking what she long to give him. But Brianne is the key to the ultimate business merger for a corrupt associate of her stepfather's--and his interest is enough to show Pierce what a treasure he might lose if he doesn't follow his heart rather than guard it.
