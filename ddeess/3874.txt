This revision of a widely adopted critical edition presents the 1831 text of Mary Shelley7;s English Romantic novel along with critical essays that introduce students to "Frankenstein" from contemporary psychoanalytic, Marxist, feminist, gender, and cultural studies perspectives. An additional essay demonstrates how various critical perspectives can be combined. In the second edition, 3 of the 6 essays are new. The text and essays are complemented by contextual documents, introductions (with bibliographies), and a glossary of critical and theoretical terms.
