Griffin & Sabine, the most creative and discussed bestseller of 1991, left readers on the edge of a precipice. In the second volume of this inventiive trilogy, they begin--along with Griffin--the fall. Told through strangely beautiful postcards and richly decorated letters--that actually must be taken from their envelopes to be read--the story is also culled from the sketchbook and diary kept by the possibly unreal Sabine. Full color throughout.
