Twelve years ago, the brutal murder of a young wife and mother rocked the quiet coastal town of Stuart, Florida-and a local troublemaker was sentenced to death for the crime. Now, new evidence has come to light, and Miami attorney Gail Conner agrees to take the case-against the wishes of her fianc√©, top criminal defense lawyer Anthony Quintana. One look at the trial transcript convinces Gail that her client was wrongfully convicted. But to save his life, she'll have to push the law to the breaking point.
