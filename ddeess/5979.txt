Still mourning her mother's death, Kimberly Richards is incensed by the determination of her father , the Earl of Amburough, to marry her off as quickly as possible--just to please the jealous lover he plans to wed. And since Kimberly harbors a deep-seated dislike of gold-diggers and the whole distasteful state of affairs, the feisty young heiress already despises the worthy suitor she encounters at Sherring Cross Estate: Lachlan MacGregor, the dashing, newly impoverished Laird of Clan MacGregor. A tryst with the handsome, haughty Lachlan seems dubious at--especially since the rogue has designs on the married Duchess of Wrothston. But strange turns and outrageous circumstances promise to lead a woefully mismatched pair to a wildly unexpected destination--where a hard, resisting heart can open to the true glories of love.
