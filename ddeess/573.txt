In this uniquely fascinating book, world-renowned psychic Sylvia Browne recounts her captivating life as a clairvoyant, telling of her earliest "readings" as a young child in Kansas City, and of her first contact with "Francine," her spirit guide. In engrossing detail, Sylvia tells how her "gift" has assisted police departments in their search for missing children and dangerous criminals—and how her predictions of deaths, plane crashes, and momentous world events were sometimes heeded—or tragically ignored. But more than anything else, this is the remarkable story of one woman’s psychic odyssey, for it offers illuminating insight into how we can better understand ourselves and our own psychic abilities. ADVENTURES OF A PSYCHIC may give you an entirely new outlook on life, death, psychic phenomena, and the "other side!"
