British expatriate Dennis Barlow is an aspiring poet who composes by day and works by night at the Happier Hunting Ground, a local pet cemetery. By chance he is called on to arrange a funeral for a fellow Brit (a victim of the movie industry) at the respendent Whispering Glades Cemetery, where he meets Aim√©e Thanatogenos, the beautiful junior cosmetician, and Mr Joyboy, the senior mortician, and the plot shifts into hilarious high gear.
