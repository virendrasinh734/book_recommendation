The second book in Card's trilogy focusing on the women of the Book of Genesis features Rebekah. Chosen by God for a special destiny, Rebekah becomes the wife of Isaac, son of Abraham, and finds herself caught up in a series of painful rivalries--first between her husband and his brother Ishmael, then between her sons Jacob and Esau.
