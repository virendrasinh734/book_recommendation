TWO SENSATIONAL NOVELS FOR ONE GREAT PRICE! Two murderers stalk their prey throughout England—from the glittering ballrooms of London to the loneliest country lanes—and two romances blossom in their dark shadows . . . LADY KILLER Three years ago Miles Loredan believed he had killed the bloodthirsty fiend known as the Vampire of London. When a beautiful sleuth named Clio Thornton stumbles upon what can only be the Vampire’s latest victim, Miles is drawn into a terrifying race against the clock. Captivated at once by intelligent, lovely Clio, his first impulse is to protect her. Because every clue points to the Vampire’s next victim: Clio. SECRET ADMIRER Lady Tuesday Arlington seeks refuge from the horrible nightmares that invade her sleep by doing what she does best—she paints them. But when her husband is found dead in a setting identical to one she has painted, she becomes the prime suspect. Lawrence Pickering, special investigator to Her Majesty, the Queen, takes over the inquiry and cannot help but fall for the beautiful and talented Tuesday. But a cruelly sinister presence waits to turn their picture-perfect love into a masterpiece of murder.
