Premier crime fiction writer Joseph Wambaugh has written one of his most tension-filled stories yet. In a rollercoaster ride of doublecrosses and murder amidst the drug dealers, sleazemongers and black marketeers of Southern California and Tijuana, a San Diego police detective searches for a deadly killer: a 55-gallon drum of the toxic chemical Guthion.
