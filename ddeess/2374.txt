On a hot night in Havana Harbor, U.S. marines sleep on the deck of the USS Maine as the sound of rumba music drifts across the water. Then, in a flash, the Maine is blown to pieces. Now a bloody carnaval of war, nations, and schemers is exploding on the dusty, sugar-rich island of Cuba. Master storyteller Elmore Leonard breaks new ground in this rip-roaring novel, a rollicking jaunt into history that sizzles with the passion of lovers, the violence of nations, and the courage of freedom fighters crying out to their firing squads: "Viva Cuba Libre!"
