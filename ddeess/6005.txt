Two years ago, a designer's passionate tryst with a handsome stranger ended in regret and longing -- and now, she must face him again while remodeling a storied Southern plantation. A tall, handsome stranger, an evening of romance, and enough heartache to last a lifetime -- in one reckless night, her life was changed forever. Two years later, Camille Jameson is a successful interior decorator with the opportunity to renovate one of Mississippi's proudest plantations. She arrives excited and eager to face her greatest professional challenge yet -- until Zack Prescott saunters through the mansion's front door and back into her life. He is exactly as she remembers, except for the knowing look in his eyes that reminds her of what they once shared. Now, forced to live in unbearably close quarters, Camille and Zack will learn whether they have the courage to face the past -- and, perhaps, build a future together . . .
