Hailed as "captivating" (Booklist) and "exquisitely sensual" (Library Journal), Jo Beverley's Malloren novels capture the unforgettable world of Georgian England. Now her fans can discover why the book that started it all, My Lady Notorious, has been called "storytelling at its best" (Rendezvous). Desperate to help her widowed sister and baby escape a deadly pursuer, Lady Chastity Ware dresses as a highwayman and captures the first coach to travel down the road. Coming face-to-face with its occupant, the arrogant aristocrat, Cyn Malloren, she orders him to drive her to a remote cottage. Little does Chastity realize that after long months of recovering from his war wounds, the handsome Cyn is looking for adventure, and being abducted by a cocky highwayman—obviously a lovely woman in disguise—is even more than he had hoped for. Willingly he is drawn into her devilishly reckless plan...and helplessly he is seduced by her wonderfully wicked ways.
