Tells how a brooding English artist - Griffin - one day begins to receive cryptic postcards from a mysterious woman in the South Seas - Sabine - who seems to have telepathic access to his paintings and sketches. Bantock unfolds his epistolary narrative via artful, symbolically laden postcards and imaginatively designed letters, in actual envelopes glued to the book's pages, making the reader an eavesdropper on the characters' intimacies.
