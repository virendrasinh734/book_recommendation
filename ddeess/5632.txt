No writer can tell a hilarious and moving story about the great truths of love, life, and friendship quite like Marian Keyes. Each of her internationally bestselling novels introduced a heroine so real, she felt like a long-lost friend. Now Keyes delivers her best novel yet.... Lost Chance Saloon Tara, Katherine, and Fintan have been friends since the days when leg warmers were cool. All through their twenties they shared their joys, heartbreaks, and endless giddy nights out. But now they've graduated to their slightly more serious thirties -- and only Fintan has what can honestly be called a "love life." Tara struggles daily with her eternal diet -- and lies to herself about Thomas, her lowlife boyfriend. He keeps his change in a little-old-lady's purse and wouldn't pay a compliment if there was a cash award attached to it. But when you're in your early thirties and comfortably seated in the "last chance saloon," sometimes a dubious man seems safer than no man at all. Katherine, on the other hand, feels that the safest relationship is the one she has with her TV remote control. She wants no surprises and keeps her life as ordered as her drawer full of matching bra-and-panty sets, even when the guys at work start calling her the Ice Queen. But it's always when you are least ready for change that life insists on one. Fate is about to throw a curve ball that will lead Fintan to extract a very serious promise from his two best friends. And when catastrophe inevitably follows crisis, everyone's fife is sure to change in unexpected ways ... and not necessarily for the worse.
