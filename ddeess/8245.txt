Dana Underhill's artistic gift has led her all over the world. Her underwater canvases evoke all the beauty of the seas she and her sister, Lily, have sailed since childhood. But when a shattering event takes Lily from her forever, Dana must leave her artist's life and return to Connecticut to become a mother to her nieces, Allie and Quinn. Quinn is convinced her parents' deaths at sea were no accident, and Dana, too, is troubled by the puzzle of what could have gone so wrong on that clear, moonlit night. Support comes to Dana unexpectedly in the person of Sam Trevor, a young marine biologist. As Dana searches for the truth behind what happened that night, she must first find the strength to look into her own heart for the truth about her future.
