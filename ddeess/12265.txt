In this captivating romance about the inimitable Duncan sisters and their clandestine matchmaking service, a handsome new client throws youngest sister Chastity into an unexpected quandary. Chastity listens to Dr. Douglas Farrell’s distressingly unromantic requirements for a wife: wealth and social status. Her instinct is to refuse service to the tall, muscular, dark-eyed physician, but she can’t turn away a paying client. Yet the doctor conceals a secret. He’s prepared to sacrifice his bachelorhood for his true passion: caring for the poorest of London’s poor. Of course, his dream requires capital. For that, he is convinced he needs a well-to-do, well-connected wife. Little does Chastity know that if she ever learned the selfless truth, the handsome doctor just might steal her heart. And if Douglas ever lifted the veil that covers this mysterious woman, he might discover his perfect match.
