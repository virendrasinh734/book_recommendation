Road trip! It started out as an impulsive lark for Lily Morrisette, fueled by her strong chemical reaction to sexy Zach Taylor. A tough, blustery, yet tender-in-spite-of-himself career military man, Zach's determined to break up his darling "baby sister" Glynnis's wedding engagement . . . and Lily's coming along for the ride. But there's no Glynnis waiting for them at the end of the lineâ€”only a ransom note . . . and a death threat. Amid a dangerous nest of family secrets, the heat between Zach and Lily soon becomes unbearable as a kidnapper's dark and twisted scheme pulls them closer than either dreamed possible. And when passion explodes, Lily's reckless act could prove to be either the best risk she's ever taken . . . or her last.
