Greg and Ira used to be do-good lawyers and partners, until it all went bad for Ira. Bad enough that he wakes up in jail staring at a death sentence for murder. Only Greg has a chance of getting him off--if he's willing to cross certain ethical lines. Greg peels back layer after layer of lies and finds Sandy, who says she was with Ira the night of the murder and saw the whole thing. The prosecution believes she's the perfect witness. But what if Greg can persuade her to tell the truth? Wouldn't Sandy then become the perfect witness for the defense?
