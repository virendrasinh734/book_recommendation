From the glittering courts of Elizabethan England to the storm-tossed cliffs of the Scottish Highlands comes a dazzling tale of seduction, danger, and desire by one of America's bestselling and beloved authors, Iris Johansen. She was a beautiful pawn in a game of love and death. When Princess Kathryn Kentyre is snatched from a life of captivity by the mysterious Black Robert of Craighdu, she is torn between absolute terror and soaring hope, He had been chosen to protect her from the dangers surrounding her, yet the moment he swept her away she knew this rogue of a Scottish laird would prove a greater threat than any she faced from her enemies. He was a warrior-chief torn between duty and desire. Sensuous as sin itself and wild as his native Scottish Highlands, Robert MacDarren had no intention of settling down with one woman. Yet the agreement he'd struck to keep the peace required he marry the orphaned beauty and bring her back to his castle at Craigdhu for safekeeping. It was to be a marriage in name onlyâ€”and only for one year. He never suspected that the meek hostage he had been promised would prove to be this firebrand of a woman who would challenge his mind, around his passion, and lay siege to his heart.
