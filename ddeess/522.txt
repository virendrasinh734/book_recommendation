Trinity Harbor, Virginia, is in a uproar when spinster Daisy Spencer takes in a wild ten-year-old boy and starts to play "Mom". But Walker Ames, the boy's D.C. cop uncle, shows up, looking for a chance to play "Dad" for his nephew. Daisy and Walker are opposites in every way. If Daisy could only keep her thoughts about that man away from those of marriage and love.
