Best-selling authors Tim LaHaye and Jerry B. Jenkins deliver a great page-turning combination of fiction and prophecy in the fifth book in the Left Behind series, Apollyon. The Tribulation Force travels to Israel for the Meeting of Witnesses as further judgments are released upon the world. Satan falls from heaven and opens the bottomless pit, releasing Apollyon and his plague of locusts that torture the unsaved. Apollyon is a thriller that will be tough to put down.
