"After winning awards for her delightful historical romances, author Millie Criswell has now turned her talents to contemporary fiction, whipping up delicious confections of romantic mischief filled with refreshing wit and charm. In What to do About Annie?" a provocative game of revenge turns into a most unexpected date with destiny. WHAT TO DO ABOUT ANNIE? She's outspoken and outrageous. She's tired of swimming in the dating pool. And most of all, Annie Goldman has played bridesmaid for the last time. Of course no one would ever suspect that she still carries a torch for Joe Russo. Fourteen years ago, Joe ruined her with seductive promises of love and a future. That was right before he became a priest. But seeing Joe at her best friend's wedding makes Annie realize: it's time to forget Father What-A-Waste and grow up. Even as a teenager, Annie had a body made for sin. And young Joe had been willing to break a few commandments. Now, more than a decade later, Joe is ready to quit the priesthood and is prepared to face the delectable woman he tried to pray out of his system. He wants her forgiveness-what he gets is an unholy torture that's impossible to resist . . .
