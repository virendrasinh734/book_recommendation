Tamba thinks her dreams have come true when her wealthy and educated uncle offers to sponsor her education. But mission school carries a heavy price. Yet it is her worldly cousin, Nyasha, brought up in England and now a stranger among her own people, who pays the full cost of alienation. Winner of the Africa section of the Commonwealth Writers Prize, 1989.
