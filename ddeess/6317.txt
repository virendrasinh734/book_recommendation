In the tradition of "The Illustrated Screwtape Letters" and "The Illustrated Elements of Style," this beautiful keepsake edition of what has become perhaps the most important Christian book of the 20th century will include art, a new Foreword, a ribbon marker, and background material to celebrate the 60th anniversary of its publication.
