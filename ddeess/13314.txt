... And just who is Leo Waterman? A soft-hearted sleuth with a rebellious streak left over from the '60s, Leo Waterman seems to get entangled in, every oddball situation from Seattle to Puget Sound. So when he's hired to locate Caroline Nobel, an errant mob heiress with an environmentalist's heart, Leo goes with the flow -- leaving behind the familiar sights of Pioneer Square to follow the landscape-loving activist into the rain-soaked Washington woods. But Caroline's conscientious cohorts are dragging her deeper into the murky waters of environmental sabotage. And her hotheaded enthusiasm can't be cooled, even after two people are brutally murdered. Caroline's onto something extremely toxic. And unless Waterman can clear the air, her deadly dedication could poison him as well.
