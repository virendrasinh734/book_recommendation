"You're in danger. You and Amanda." The warning draws Bonnie Wheeler to a place she has never been: To the brutally slain body of her husband's ex-wife . . . To the shattering of her perfect world by a murdered woman's secrets . . . To a place where every truth becomes a lie—and every loved one is a stranger . . . To a gathering darkness that threatens her innocent child—and herself . . . To a home where nothing is safe, and there's no one she can trust. No one.
