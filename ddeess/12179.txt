The story begins in the aftermath of Memnoch the Devil. Vampires from all over the globe have gathered around Lestat, who lies prostrate on the floor of a cathedral. As Armand reflects on Lestat's condition, he is drawn to tell the story of his own life. His story begins in Russia, from where he was sold as a slave in Renaissance Venice. It sweeps through several hundred years from 15th century Constantinople to 19th century Paris to present-day New Orleans.
