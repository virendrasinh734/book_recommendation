Brilliantly stretching literary conventions, the author of Stones from the River creates a funny and original novel within a novel that explores the doubts, decisions, and "might-have-beens" that mark not only the writing process, but life itself. "A lively first novel about the layered realities of a woman's life".--Robin Morgan. Copyright Â© Libri GmbH. All rights reserved.
