While vacationing in a small village, Scotland Yard superintendent Richard Jury finds the body of notorious philanderer Simon Lean. An endless list of suspects leads Jury and Melrose Plant to a London pub called the Five Bells and Bladebone, where he learns about Lean's liaison with a woman who could have helped solve the case--if she weren't already dead.
