After a terrible accident, pilot Penny Chestnut is grounded, leaving her with time to ponder whether her plane was tampered with and what to do about an old crush on Wyatt McGregor. She's also curious about the disappearance of Wyatt's uncle Colt in the 1930s--his plane crashed and the body was never found. As Penny starts digging, it becomes clear that someone doesn't want her to find out the truth--about Colt or her own accident--and falling in love with Wyatt only complicates things.
