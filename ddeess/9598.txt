Special Agent C.J. Jones looked forward to impending motherhood but cursed being sidelined on a serial killer case because of it. And her irresistible partner Byron Warrick made it hard for her to play it safe. Then, one night, C.J. went into labor with Warrick right beside her. And everything changed. The second Warrick saw the little girl, he knew he was in love with C.J. and her baby. And as he and C.J. hunted down a madman, Warrick ensured their safety and hoped they'd become a family--that is, if C.J. wasn't too stubborn to love again. One way or another, if they survived this assignment, Warrick would persuade C.J. to take on the mission of a lifetime--as his wife!
