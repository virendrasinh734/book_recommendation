The beloved Sparhawk undertakes a perilous new quest in the Tamuli series from New York Times bestselling author David Eddings. Danger stalked Queen Ehlana’s realm. It began with peasants whispering that the bloody heroes of old would rise again. Soon outlaw bands were ravaging the hill country, while the Trolls disappeared from their icy northern haunts—and none could say where they had gone. Then came an ambassador from the far-off Tamul empire, begging aid. Monsters, ancient warriors, and foul magics were tearing their empire apart. Sparhawk, Ehlana’s champion and Prince Consort, was the Emperor’s last hope, for surely the knight who had killed the evil God Azash could prevail against the terror in Tamuli. Thus did Sparhawk and his Queen begin the perilous trek to the far-distant empire of the east. With them journeyed a handful of trusted companions: the stalwart champions of the four Militant Orders, the knight Berit, Mirtai the giantess, Princess Danae, and the young thief Talen. At the journey’s end waited a glittering court seething with corruption, treachery—and the greatest danger Sparhawk would ever face!
