The killer knows Eve Duncan all too well. He knows the pain she still feels for her murdered daughter, Bonnie, whose body has never been found. He knows that as one of the nation's top forensic sculptors, she will insist on identifying nine skeletons unearthed on a bluff near Georgia's Talladega Falls. And he knows that she will want to believe that the skeleton belonging to a young girl is Bonnie's.So begins the killer's sadistic game. Soon the phone calls to Eve begin. Sly, insinuating, chilling. Whoever is on the other end of the line is watching every move she makes. He savors her pain. He could strike at any time. But that's not what he wants -- not yet.In a heartbeat, Eve's life is turned upside down, and no one can help her. Because the killer wants her alone. Now Eve must match wits with the most dangerous of psychopaths. A man for whom life and death is little more than a game. A killing game. And he won't stop playing until he's gotten the one thing he wants the most: Eve's life.
