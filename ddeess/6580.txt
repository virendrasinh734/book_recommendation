This volume presents an evaluation of the quality and financial successes of the Disney Company's ventures. It also provides an overview of and behind-the-scenes information about 30 Disney animated films from "Snow White" through "The Hunchback of Notre Dame". The author relates each film to its original tale, gives the Disney version, and tells what and why cuts were made. The exposed secrets consist of such things as "Plot Holes," "Bloopers," "Hidden Images," and "Strange Reactions." Anecdotes about the growth of the Disney industry and the development of the theme-park rides are included. One of the most enticing sidebars offers over 50 names that were originally considered for the seven dwarfs.
