The trouble begins in Mexico, where Samson is on the trail of his Soviet opposite number: Erich Stinnes, a KGB major whom London Central wishes to recruit, to enroll, to coax over to the West ... The task of laying the delicate and elaborate groundwork for Stinnes's defection propels Samson from Mexico to London, to Paris, Berlin, and the Wast-West border. What happens along the way -- a temporary abduction, an unnecessary murder, an inconvenient suicide -- happens so fast that Samson hardly seems able to keep London Central informed of developments. Or is it that Samson WANTS to keep his colleagues in the dark?
