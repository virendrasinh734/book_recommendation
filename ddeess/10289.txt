After years in the United States, Jane returns to the tranquil Scottish estate, Elvie, where she'd spent a magical childhood. Memories of Elvie have always summoned the image of Sinclair, the rakish man she had once dreamed of marrying, but now that she is home, she finds Sinclair a different man. His charm has a purpose, and Jane can no longer trust him or herself. Copyright Â© Libri GmbH. All rights reserved.
