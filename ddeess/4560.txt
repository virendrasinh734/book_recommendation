In this first novel in the New York Times and USA TODAY bestselling McKettrick Cowboys trilogy, three brothers are in a race against time to inherit their father’s ranch. One ranch. Three sons. Only one will inherit, and on one condition. Tired of waiting for his sons to settle down, Arizona-territory rancher Angus McKettrick announces a competition: the first son to marry and produce a grandchild will inherit Triple M ranch. Now, three distinctly different, equally determined cowboys are searching high and low for brides. Rafe McKettrick loves only one thing more than his freedom—the Triple M ranch. In his bid to win it, he marries a woman he’s never met. To his surprise, Emmeline is as beautiful as she is spirited…but she’s clearly hiding a secret. Emmeline Harding discovered she couldn’t hold her liquor the hard way. Uncertain why she woke up next to a stack of gold coins in a brothel and fearing the worst, she fled town as a mail-order bride. Now, she must confess her past to her handsome new husband. But as the newlyweds are suspiciously circling each other, a visitor from the past enters the high country. Can Rafe and Emmeline give up on a marriage in name only and seek a union that satisfies them body and soul?
