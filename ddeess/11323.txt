Now a major motion picture from Twentieth-Century Fox starring Jennifer Aniston, Alan Alda, Timothy Daly, Nigel Hawthorne, John Pankow, Stephen Baldwin and Paul Rudd. When 26-year-old George Mullen is kicked out by his lover, Robert, he moves into the terminally disordered apartment of Nina Borowski--and the role of surrogate unwed father.
