Psychotherapist Katherine DeQuincy is torn between two brothers: handsome, successful Eric Airie and Pilot, her haunted, schizophrenic patient. Especially when Pilot begins telling her secrets only he knows and only he can share... "I AM OMNISCIENT". Allowing herself to fall in love with Eric and trying to save Pilot, Katherine grapples with the mystery the two brothers have in common: the agonizing disappearance of their younger sister twenty years ago. "I KNOW WHO KILLED HER". A woman whose own life has unraveled, Katherine is venturing into the mind of a schizophrenic, and a maze of deception, betrayal, and danger. For what tragedy tore apart two decades ago, blood still holds together: Someone in this family murdered one of his or her own -- and will kill again. "I CAN PROVE IT".
