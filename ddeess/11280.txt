A cozy bed, a snoring granny, a dreaming child, a dozing dog, a snoozing--WAIT! There's a surprise in store, and little ones will want to discover it over and over again. So pull on your sleeping cap and snuggle in for a timeless cumulative tale that's truly like no other. Don and Audrey Wood's beloved picture book has sold more than one and a half million copies. To celebrate its birthday, the original hardcover book now has a fresh new design for both the jacket and interior, and the reproduction of the illustrations has been enhanced to better match the original artwork. A CD is tucked into a sleeve on the inside the front cover. The music, originally produced in 1989, is based on the book and was written and performed by children's musicians Carl and Jennifer Shaylen. The CD begins with a reading of the story and follows with six original songs that are just as fun, jaunty, and sweet as the book itself.
