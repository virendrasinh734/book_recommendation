Set on the untamed frontier, Cassie Edwards' Savage series--awarded the Romantic Times Lifetime Achievement Award for Best Indian Series--features stories of rugged warriors from different tribes and their tantalizingly sensual adventures with young and innocent heroines. In Savage Spirit, Chief Cloud Eagle has tamed the wild beasts of his land, yet one glimpse of the flame-haired Alicia makes him a slave to desire.
