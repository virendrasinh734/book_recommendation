A restless warrior... A fierce maiden... A magical love story of sorcery and passion... Orphaned as a child and raised by monks, Mychael ab Arawn had forsaken all things of the world-- until fiery visions drew him into the victorious battle to reclaim his ancestral home. Yet peace still eludes him, for the visions of mystical dragons and mysterious caverns linger. Armed as a warrior once more, Mychael prepares for his quest--to seek out the images that haunt him and conquer them once and for all. There are many who would stay Mychael, intent on using him for their own purposes. Only the beautiful Llynya, with her lavender scent and lightning-fast blade, joins him on his path. But Mychael may have little chance to taste the sensual power that draws him to the maiden. For soon his visions will lead them to a crossroads of destiny, where danger awaits in every cavern--and friends and ancient enemies of man threaten to destroy them.
