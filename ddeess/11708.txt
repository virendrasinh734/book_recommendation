Santaroga seems to be nothing more than a prosperous farming community, but there is something different about it. It has no crime at all. Outsiders find no houses for sale or rent in the valley, and no one ever moves out. Maybe Santaroga is the last outpost of American individualism. Or maybe there is something extraordinary at work there--something far more disturbing than anyone imagines.
