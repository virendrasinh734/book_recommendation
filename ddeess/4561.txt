HONOR YOUR WIFE. SERVE YOUR COUNTRY. CONCEAL THE TRUTH. Do you ever really know the person you married? Claire Heller Chapman, a Harvard Law School professor and a high-powered attorney, has just attained a national reputation for her work on several high-profile cases. Her second husband, Tom Chapman, is a successful moneymanager who adores Claire and her six-year-old daughter. They live in a beautiful house and lead a glamorous and happy life. Then a random burglary turns their world upside down. A routine police investigation reveals that Tom is not who he says he is. He never attended the college he said he did. He once had a different name. He once was, Claire learns, a secret operative for the U.S. government. When he is suddenly arrested and put on trial for a crime he insists he didn't commit -- an unspeakable atrocity carried out thirteen years ago -- she puts her reputation on the line to defend him. The case is tried in a top-secret court-martial conducted by the Pentagon, in which all the evidence is classified, and the rules are unlike any Claire has ever known. She struggles to work within the system, passionately trying to believe in Tom's innocence, even as all the evidence seems to indicate that her husband is a cold-blooded murderer.
