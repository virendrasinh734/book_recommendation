Through four intertwined mini-novels, all contained in this volume, readers take a thrill ride through the glamorous domain of L.A.'s ultra-rich--where making a fortune is a high stakes game, and where a killer stalks the most decadent and daring players. Published by Pocket Books in separate volumes; this is the first omnibus edition.
