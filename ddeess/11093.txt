Autumn in the sleepy California town of Pine Cove is turned upside down by the arrival of a Mississippi Delta blues musician, a huge sea serpent drawn to the sound of the steel guitar, the explosion of a tanker truck at the local gas station, and a mysterious trailer that shows up in the local trailer park. Reprint. 48,000 first printing.
