Listen, Drummond, your client betrayed this country in ways too horrible to contemplate....In the history of espionage, there's never been one like him. But Major Sean Drummond never says die. Especially when an old flame begs him to defend her brigadier general husband in the biggest treason case in U.S. history. And even when Drummond is up against the fiercest prosecutor in the Army and fighting two murder charges. With an unconventional and beautiful co-counsel, Drummond plunges into an investigation that will unearth a damning array of secrets and cover-ups-and reveal a master manipulator who doesn't care who or what goes up in flames...as long as Drummond's client burns.
