Midnight Louie is the savvy black tomcat who stars in his very own series by Carole Nelson Douglas. One tough hombre, he knows the score and always gets his man or rat. Louie's hot on a new case, a whole bunch in fact, in Midnight Louie's Pet Detectives. He's pulled together stories of mystery, murder, and mayhem to bring us some of the wildest; and furriest; cases around, written by today's most prominent authors. With an introduction from Lawrence Block and all-new stories from such masters of the mystery as Dorothy Cannell, J.A. Jance, Nancy Pickard, and Ann Perry, as well as a reprint from Lilian Jackson Braun, Midnight Louie's Pet Detectives is a treat for mystery readers and animal lovers of all flavors.
