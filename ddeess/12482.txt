The first of Gertrude Stein's publications, this accessible 1909 volume was an experiemntal work for its time and established the author's reputation as a master of language and a voice for women. In three separate tales, Stein invests the lives of three working class women with extraordinary insights into race, sex, gender, and other feminist issues.
