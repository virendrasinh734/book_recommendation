"Laced with heartbreak, drama and thrills...Marvelously readable." THE PHILADELPHIA INQUIRER It's 1940 and Linda Voss, secretary extraordinaire, has a secret: she's in love with her boss, John Berringer, the pride of the Ivy Leage. Not that he'd take a second look at her, a German-Jewish girl from Queens who spends her time caring for her faded beauty of a mother, and following the news of the war that is engulfing Europe. How Linda wins and loses her man, puts her life on the line for her beliefs, and finally gets the man she deserved all along is the story that only Susan Isaacs, author of the accalimed bestseller MAGIC HOUR, can tell.
