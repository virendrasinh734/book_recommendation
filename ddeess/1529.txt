Violence suddenly takes the lead in the life of Neil Griffon. First his father, a stable owner, suffers a grisly accident, then Neil is brutally assaulted and abducted. The price for his freedom will mean the betrayal and deception of those who trust Griffon most. But he has no choice: A no-compromise crime czar has made an ultimatum--that his own eighteen-year old son be hired by Griffon's stables to ride the superstar horse, Archangel, in the Derby. And the young man must be trained to win. Or else.... "Few things are more convincing than Dick Francis at a full gallop." CHICAGO TRIBUNE
