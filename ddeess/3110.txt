Over the course of a long and celebrated career, Ray Bradbury has traveled many roads: cruising down country highways that wound through the unseen heart of small-town America; exploring rutted backwoods paths that led to dark and dangerous places; racing at mach-speed along shimmering celestial turnpikes as limitless and exciting as the unbound imagination. The Dean of American storytellers, Bradbury cherishes the worlds he envisions through his windshield. And with incomparable skill and an infectious wonder undiminished by years, he shares what he sees--so that we might also appreciate the view. DRIVING BLIND is a stunning new collection of short fiction--the first since the publication of Bradbury's critically acclaimed Quicker Than the Eye. With a steady hand on the wheel, the master once again transports us to remarkable places-- and to warm and achingly familiar destinations of the heart, revealed as we've never seen them before in the brilliance of day or gloom of night. Here are unforgettable excursions to the fantastic, glorious grand tours through time and memory-- interspersed with strange, unexpected side trips to the disturbing and eerie--where surprises are waiting around every curve and just beyond each mile marker. These are new roads we have never ridden before--sprawling interstates and lush, twisting rural routes fraught with dangers and delights of all manner, shape and substance. With Ray Bradbury in the driver's seat, the journey promises to be a memorable one. Come along and enjoy the ride.
