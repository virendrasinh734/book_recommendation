The best-selling young adult novelist recounts her daughter's mysterious shooting death and her own investigation into the crime, describing her use of a psychic to contact her dead child and expose the truth. “Later! I’ll see you guys later!” They were the last words Lois Duncan would ever hear her daughter speak. On a balmy midsummer’s night in 1989, eighteen-year-old Kaitlyn Arquette was shot to death as she drove home along a deserted strip of new Mexico highway. The police called it a random shooting—even though it had all the earmarks of a professional hit. . . . Who would put out a contract on a beautiful young honor student? Was it grief that made Kaitlyn’s Vietnamese lover try to take his own life?—or was it not an attempted suicide at all? Lois Duncan’s search for answers would take her into the underworld of Vietnamese gangs that stretched across three states. It would lead her to an extraordinary psychic and to a courageous journalist determined to expose the devastating truth. And it would send her on a numbing odyssey into Kaitlyn’s shocking secret life as she desperately sought justice for the daughter she would always love . . . even in the face of shattering betrayal and threats to her own life. . . . Praise for Who Killed My Daughter? “Duncan’s anguish and frustration surface on practically every page of this sad but intriguing mystery. Her forays into the realm of psychics and dreams are downright eerie.”—The Plain Dealer “Who Killed My Daughter? is a story of sadness, frustration and hope. . . . It is an emotional book that reads more like a novel than nonfiction.”—San Antonio Express-News “This book is especially well written, perhaps because Duncan’s writing comes from her broken heart and anguished soul.”—Library Journal “Ms. Duncan is an award-winning yong adult novelist. She does a remarkable job of organizing the untidy events of real life into a cohesive, readable narrative.”—The Atlanta Journal and Constitution
