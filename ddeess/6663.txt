“She invades the turf of John le Carré. . . . It is very good.”—Los Angeles Times Book Review Barrie Mayer, a beautiful Washington literary agent, arrives at London’s Heathrow Airport with plenty of time to make her flight to Budapest, where she’s planning to meet an author. The airport is crowded, but it’s not a scheduling problem that keeps Barrie from getting off the ground.

Then Collette gets the order from above: Find out what happened to Barrie. And, more important, what happened to her briefcase.
