Not Looking For Mr. Right? Dr. Delaney Poole thinks Harp Cove, Maine, will be the perfect place to settle down and raise her infant daughter -- though she can't say why. Something wonderful happened in this charming, two-spotlight coastal town on a previous summer night, when a sexy stranger stole his way briefly into her heart and then moved on. But now single-mom Delaney has to invent a husband in order to deflect small town gossip -- buying masculine clothing that no one will ever wear, framing pictures she's cut from magazine. Her foolproof plan has one small glitch, however: her one-time mystery man is Delaney's new landlord! Jack Shepard never dreamed he'd see Delaney again -- and he doesn't believe for one minute her cockamamie story about a husband! While he's exploring the leaks in Delaney's bathroom -- and in her alleged "marriage" -- he's trying desperately to get her to admit that they share something special. But when the truth does come out, can Jack and Delaney deal with the passionate consequence?
