Nothing can prepare criminal attorney Bennie Rosato for her new client, Alice Connolly, who bears an uncanny physical resemblance to her and tells her, "Pleased to meet you. I'm your twin."

Bennie takes on the woman's defense in a murder case and plunges into the mystery of the murderâ€”as well as the secret of her own identity. Not until the verdict is in will she finally learn the truth.
