Nina Chickalini has a plan: Get out of Queens. But something keeps stopping her. Maybe it's the four siblings she raised almost single-handedly. Or the family pizzeria she's running so Pop can take it easy. Or maybe it's her best friend, Joe Materi, who's just made an incredible request: Have his baby! Nina doesn't need another reason to feel tied down, but how can she refuse the man who's always been there for her? Getting in the family way turns out to be easy, and suddenly she's seeing Joe in a whole new light-his muscular arms cradling a baby, his sexy voice crooning a lullaby... With the entire neighborhood meddling to get them to tie the knot-and Joe looking like he wants them to tie the knot-Nina might have to stop dreaming of grand adventures and settle for something even better: love.
