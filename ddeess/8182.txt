This fall, Paramount Pictures presents an entirely new version of the classic Audrey Hepburn/Billy Wilder love story Sabrina, in which a newly sophisticated chauffeur's daughter, fresh from Paris, must choose between two wealthy brothers she has known since girlhood. Directed by Sidney Pollack, the movie stars Julia Ormond, Harrison Ford and Greg Kinnear.
