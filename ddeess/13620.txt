With the boys keen to get it on the act this time around, we've put together a book with two front covers containing stories that will appeal to male and female alike! At one end, Girls' Night Out introduces original stories from female authors at the cutting-edge of bestselling women's fiction, including Josie Lloyd, Kathy Lette, India Knight, Arabella Weir and Sophie Kinsella. Flip the book over and enjoy Boys' Night In - a collection of stories by some of the hottest male authors around, such as Mike Gayle, Emlyn Rees, Matt Beaumont and Patrick Gale. Double the entertainment factor and a fascinating look at a variety of issues and themes, both witty and serious, from both a male and female perspective. Once again, all the writers involved have provided their story gratis, and HarperCollins will donate a least ?1 to War Child for every copy sold, continuing the amazing work for children in war zones whose lives have been torn apart by conflict. Proceeds from the previous collection created over thirty safe playgrounds in landmined Kosovo, and schools in Rwanda. Buy this book and more children's lives will be transformed.
