Fall in love with two unforgettable new novels in one extraordinary volume! Meet the Candellano family: Angela, the matriarch, Tony the oldest son and town sheriff, Nick and Paul, the twin brothers with completely different personalities, and Carla, the beautiful daughter whom Mama is still trying to fix up. And though Mama's brood is all grown up, they still gather every Sunday around her kitchen table-where anyone who falls for a Candellano had better be prepared to share laughter, love...and the best lasagna in town... FINDING YOU Carla Candellano has faced a tragedy she'd like to put behind her, but no one has been able to penetrate the wall she has built around herself-until she meets six-year-old Reese Wyatt. Reese hasn't spoken since her mother died last year, and it's friendship at first sight for Carla and little Reese. But it's the girl's worried father, Jackson, who arouses Carla's curiosity, and passion, in ways she never imagined... KNOWING YOU Ever since Stevie Ryan was a young girl, she was in love with her best friend Carla's older brother Nick Candellano. But Nick had to complicate things by growing up gorgeous-and breaking Stevie's heart. Now she's convinced that forgetting him is the way to go. And it's working out fine...until she and Nick's brother, Paul, spend one sultry night together. Has the right brother been under Stevie's nose all along?
