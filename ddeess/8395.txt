The crackling new novel in the bestselling Honor Bound series, by the master of the military thriller. As with his other enormously popular series, the first two novels in W. E .B. Griffin’s saga of World War II espionage in Germany and Argentina – Honor Bound and Blood and Honor – became immediate bestsellers and were hailed as “immensely entertaining adventures” (Kirkus Reviews). Now, in Secret Honor, Griffin creates his most rousing novel yet. In Wolf’s Lair, a German general works toward the assassination of Adolf Hitler. In Buenos Aires, the general’s son, code-named Galahad, falls under suspicion by the SS after a Nazi operation suddenly goes bad. In the middle of it all is OSS agent Cletus Frade, who knows the identity of father and son and what they will do next…if they can survive that long. For not only are SS and Abwehr officers hot on their trails in both countries, but the OSS has branded Frade a rogue agent and is determined to shake the truth from him, at whatever cost. If Frade can’t figure a way to hold them all off, then the futures of all three men may be very short indeed…. Written with the special flair that Griffin’s readers expect, filled with high drama and real heroes, Secret Honor is further proof, in Tom Clancy’s words, that “Griffin is a storyteller in the grand tradition.”
