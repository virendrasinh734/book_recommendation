Jude Deveraux's sizzling New York Times bestseller is a page-turning mix of thrilling sensuality, warmhearted wit, and hot-blooded suspense. A rising corporate star, Fiona Burkenhalter is a New Yorker through and through. When her boss sends her to the Florida Everglades to accompany a wealthy new client on a rustic fishing expedition, it may as well be another planet to city slicker Fiona. She's more than a little steamed at this detour from the executive fast track -- until she meets the expedition's larger-than-life guide, Ace Montgomery. Entirely out of her element, Fiona becomes mired in a maze of hair-raising circumstances the moment she arrives in Florida. Inexplicably pegged as the prime suspect for a shocking murder, Fiona finds that her only ally is Ace. As an irresistible chemistry flares -- and with their lives and hearts on the line -- they turn up the heat in their desperate search for a killer. Take off on a wild ride with High Tide, and discover once more why Jude Deveraux's spellbinding novels soar onto bestseller lists -- and win the hearts of millions -- time after time.
