The story focuses on southern Florida at the height of the tourist season, when a ferocious hurricane hits--luring con artists, carpetbaggers, and would-be saviours like hyenas to the lion's kill. "Hiaasen (hilself is a one-man force of nature".--Variety. Major advertising, including key city radio and print ads in The New York Times Book Review and Miami Herald.
