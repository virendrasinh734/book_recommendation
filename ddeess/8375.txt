Bestselling author Fern Michaels touches the hearts of her readers by exploring the breadth of one woman’s deepest experiences as the Seasons of Her Life unfold. Ruby is determined to have a better life when she leaves her bitter childhood behind for post–World War II Washington, D.C. Working for the navy as a secretary, she is young, pretty, and happy for the first time . . . and she falls in love. The harsh reality of life as a military wife—and the loneliness that comes with it—destroys her illusions but fuels a fire of strength and independence that will burn throughout her life. She raises two children mostly by herself, creates a home out of dreary quarters, and begins baking cookies in the hopes of building a business. After years of struggle, Mrs. Sugar’s Cookies succeeds beyond her wildest dreams. But closest to her heart is the memory of the man she longs for in her soul. Beautifully written and deeply romantic, Seasons of Her Life is a novel that will be savored long after the last page is turned.
