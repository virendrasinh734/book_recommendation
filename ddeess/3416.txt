A charming illustrated book giving the answer to the question: What is happiness? Selma the sheep can answer this question easily. Happiness is to eat grass while the sun shines, to have a chat with her neighbour, teach the little ones to speak and to have a good nights sleep; all the while eating grass. But what would happen if Selma were to have more time or won the lottery? The simple answer to what is happiness has sold over 120,000 copies in Germany so far, as well as being a bestseller in Holland and other European countries.
