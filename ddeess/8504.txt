The first novel in the original saga based on the movie Willow From George Lucas, creator of Star Wars and Indiana Jones, and Chris Claremont, author of the bestselling X-Men adventures, comes a dazzling tale of adventure and magic. . . . Thirteen years have passed since the epic battle of Nockmaar freed the land from a tyrant's grasp. But in the time since, the countryside has been wracked by war and chaos. According to the prophecy, there is but one hope of deliverance: the Princess Elora Danan. Raised friendless and alone, she has grown into a royal spoiled brat. The fate of the Great Realms rests in her hands, and she couldn't care less. It will take a stranger named Thorn Drumheller to fight the opposing forces of unimaginable malevolence--but first he must strike a devil's bargain and resurrect a powerful warrior from her soulless sleep, bringing her into a world of blood and horror where shadows have declared war on the light.
