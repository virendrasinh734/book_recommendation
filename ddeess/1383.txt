Merci Rayborn, T. Jefferson Parker's stubborn, principled Orange Countydetective, is almost alone in believing that deputy Archie Wildcraft didn't killhis beautiful young wife and then turn his service weapon on himself. Theevidence against Wildcraft--now hospitalized with a bullet lodged in hishead--seems overwhelming. But Merci, who's still unpopular for exposing an oldpolice scandal that caused the death of one cop and the ruination of others(The Blue Hour), isresisting pressure from her boss and a headline-hunting D.A. to arrest Wildcraftand charge him with murder.Then the deputy, who's lost his memory and maybe his mind as a result of hisinjury, goes missing from his hospital room, intent on tracking down the realkillers and managing to stay a step ahead of Merci. Soon, they both begin torealize that Gwen Wildcraft wasn't killed because she got in the way of anattempted hit on her husband--it was the other way around. Parker, whose skillsat characterization are as well honed as his expert pacing and intricateplotting, has penned another standout that will keep readers guessing andgasping until the last dramatic page. --Jane Adams
