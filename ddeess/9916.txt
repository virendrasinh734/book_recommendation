NATIONAL BESTSELLER • When the world is your oyster, you need a cat to enjoy it with you. “An entertaining romp that leaves no doubt that Mr. Gethers and his cat have a most remarkable relationship.”—Kiki Olson, The New York Times Book Review At one time in his life, Peter Gethers, publisher, screenwriter, and author, was a confirmed loner and cat hater. All that changed when a Scottish Fold kitten named Norton entered his life. Peter opened his heart to Norton and soon they were inseparable. Together they rode the ferry to Fire Island, traversed the subways of Manhattan, traveled on the Concorde to Paris, dated beautiful women, and even dined in the world’s finest restaurants. Norton knows how to impress simply by being himself—an amusing and intelligent companion who understands silence, enjoys the thrill of the chase, and gladly accepts the devotion of man and womankind. He also teaches his fallible owner how to live, love, and be a compassionate human being. The Cat Who Went to Paris proves that sometimes all it takes is paws and personality to change a life.
