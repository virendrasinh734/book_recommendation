Now international bestseller SARK offers a guide to achieving health, wealth, and well-being through the simple joy of naps. An experienced napper herself, SARK shows how a good nap can make you more deluxe, creative, sexy, funny, intriguing, and flexible. Conjuring up the hours of 'quiet time' we all remember from childhood, she suggests great places for napping, provides instructions for indulging in fantasy naps, and offers a host of good excuses for taking a nap. Featuring SARK's drawings in full colour on every page, CHANGE YOUR LIFE WITHOUT GETTING OUT OF BED is the perfect gift for mothers and their families. For, as Maya Angelou put it, 'We, in the world, and this weary old world itself, have a gaping need for SARK. Let's call for more and more SARK to fill every child's book bag and each attache case.'
