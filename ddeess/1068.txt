“There have been any number of books of interview with contemporary writers, but none precisely like this one. The author/editor has somehow managed to get these very different poets to follow his lead and (in many cases for the first time anywhere) to reveal much about their intellectual habits, assumptions, and preconceptions. In almost every case he has been able to get these poets to talk more openly and freely than anyone else has ever done.” – George Garrett
