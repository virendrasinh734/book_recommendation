From Wendy Markham, author of HELLO, IT'S ME, soon to be a Hallmark movie. Love Can Be A Royal Pain! A most impetuous princess, Her Highness, Emmaline of Verdunia, would have wed her suitable prince and been done with it—if she hadn't been swept off her feet by Granger Lockwood IV, "America's Sexiest Single Man." Their one brief dalliance was indeed magical—but now her wedding gown is feeling a bit tight in the waist. So Emmaline flees, hurtling across the Atlantic in the private jet of the surprised playboy who ruined her life . . . or, quite possibly, set her free. Now everyone is looking for Emmaline, from the press and paparazzi to her irate royal family and furious fiancé. And Granger, after pulling off the decade's most daring rescue, now has a pampered princess on his hands who's gone from pomp and circumstance to Big Macs and daytime soaps. Worse still, he's actually falling for this delightfully infuriating blue blood—and he's the last man on Earth she could ever marry!
