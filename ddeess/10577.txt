Bounty hunter Marty Keller doesn’t expect his job to be easy—but he does expect to be paid. Stagecoach company owner Malcolm O’Brian has put a price on the head of a stagecoach robber, but money is the one thing he doesn’t have. After Keller dodges a hail of bullets to bring in the wanted man, he’s more than a little curious how O’Brian plans to pay. The stagecoach owner promises him double, if Keller can rid him of the threat to his stagecoach line for good. Now the bounty hunter is riding shotgun and aiming to take on as many outlaws as necessary—because on this trip the cargo is hot lead and cold death.
