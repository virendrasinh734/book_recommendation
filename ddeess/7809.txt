From a "new, strong and original voice" (Los Angeles Times Book Review) and the author of Devil in a Blue Dress comes a fascinating and believable mystery set in the Red-baiting, blacklisting Los Angeles of 1953. Easy is out of the "hurting business" and into the housing (and favor) business when a racist IRS agent nails him for tax evasion. And his only way out of jail is to agree to spy on an alleged communist union organizer whose headquarters is the all-black First African Baptist Church.
