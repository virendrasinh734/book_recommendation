For more than 30 years, Charles Kuralt, the host of CBS News' "Sunday Morning," has traveled the world's byways. In this warm, deeply affecting memoir, Kuralt retraces the steps of a journey that began when he was a young CBS news reporter frantically trying to cover international events, a journey that took him to South America, Vietnam, and the Okefenokee Swamp. From an Arizona cowboy who confessed to wearing pantyhose under his chaps and a Moscow dentist who tearfully thanked former American POW's for saving his life in a German prison camp, to memorable meetings with Marlon Brando and Nikita Khrushchev---here is a story of triumphs and tragedies, swimming pigs and cattle roundups, and one man's lifelong love of the road and the people he's met along the way.
