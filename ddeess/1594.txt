In this delightful return to Paradise Beach, Erin Kelly decides to fight for her mentor, who has been declared incompetent by the courts, using every devious trick the older woman ever taught her. Erin goes up against attorney Richard Wesley III. Richard finds Erin exciting, and a little "war" never hurt anyone. Although he's secretly on Erin's side, he is bound by law to do what he must--even if it costs him her love.
