Dear Maggie. I will always love you...Keep me safe in your heart. --Rob. His letters thrilled her as a young woman in love for the first time, and now, many years later, they mean more than ever to Maggie McIntyre. After her husband of twenty years leaves her for a younger woman, it's the discovery of Robbie's letters that gives Maggie a renewed sense of purpose: to return to Little Bear Lake and recapture the woman she once was--the woman she knows she could be again. But time has changed the place she knew and loved. The Harvest Moon dance hall where she worked as a waitress is closed. Still, Maggie is determined to reopen it, with the help of friends and a special man who enters her life in a most unexpected way. As they work together to make her dream come true, a powerful attraction develops between them. Maggie struggles with her feelings for a younger man whose age stands in the way of her growing affection for him. But their passion is undeniable, and soon she will have to decide which is more important to her: what other people think, or what she feels in her heart.
