In the late 1600s, the legendary Spanish Dowry vanished when Black Maggie Verrere eloped with a stranger rather than marrying Sir Eric Neville. Now it is 150 years later, and Cassandra Verrere is desperate to find the riches in order to save her family from poverty. Unfortunately, only a Neville can help her. Clearly, he considers his hatred of her as much his birthright as the dowry is hers--but even an ancient family feud is no match for the passion that soon burns between them.
