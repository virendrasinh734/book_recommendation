Cincinnati heart surgeoun Darryl Sutorious was spellbound, convinced he'd found the perfect wife. With bewitching hazel eyes and exquisite clothes, Cante Britteon seemed to have stepped straight out of Vogue and into his arms. But their honeymoon didn't last long. Beneath Dante's china-doll facade lured a sceretive, dangerous woman, a man-hater born as Della Faye Hall, whose four previous marriages had been spiced with butcher knives, pistols, vandalized house and lover set on fire, according to the men she ensnared. And by the time Darryl—haunted by his own impotence—summoned the strength to demand out of the marriage, Della Faye was only too happy to oblige: with a bullet to the brain. In this stunning book, New York Times bestselling author Aprodite Jones traces the intricate web of this fiendishly calculating sexual con artist. From Della Faye Hall's strange childhood to her violent marriages, from the police investigation to the murder trial, this is the shocking story of a suburban femme fatale, a gold-digger driven by jealousy and greed to torture her husband to death.
