Dante is every woman's fantasy, yet he remains alone and untouched. Now screenwriter Morgan DeSilva has found his journal and revealed his secrets to the world. He must stop her, and the only way is through her dreams--erotic fantasies so real they leave their mark on both her body and soul. And yet she is powerless and unwilling to resist as Dante comes to her with the promise of immortality. Copyright Â© Libri GmbH. All rights reserved.
