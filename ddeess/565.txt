Based on an American television show, of the same name, it brims with Michael Moore's special brand of subversive humour that melds outright silliness with poignant realisation. From the oh–so–obvious Serial Killer Next Door who's ignored by his neighbours: to Mike enjoying some quality time with Dr. Kevorkian : to raising money for Charles Keating, this is a compilation of classic TV Nation that'll make you laugh and think at the same time. This book is a must read for anyone and everyone.
