INTRODUCING ERSKINE POWELL OF SCOTLAND YARD Crime, investigation, punishment. They're all in a day's work to Detective Chief Superintendent Erskine Powell of New Scotland Yard. As a member of the Yard's Murder Squad, Powell tracks miscreants all over London. Now, seeking distance from the criminal constituency--and the bureaucratic drudgery of the Yard--Powell embarks on a salmon-fishing competition in the Scottish Highlands. There, in the castle-dotted countryside along the picturesque River Spey, he seeks peace and seclusion. But a cold-blooded murderer soon turns Powell's haven into a busman's holiday--and a quiet anglers' paradise becomes just as deadly as the mean streets of London.
