A single mom turned stripper finds herself locking horns with a high-powered Congressman when a bachelor party gets out of hand in this inventive tale yet of savage appetites and sweet justice. Only in America could an innocent, if drunken, guest of honor at a strip joint bachelor party become a mortal threat against Big Money and Big Government. Only in south Florida, land of roadside honky-tonks and sinister pleasure boats -- not to mention blackmail and murder -- would a virtuous topless dancer join forces with a cool but clueless cop. And only in the fiction of Carl Hiaasen do readers experience riveting suspense and razor-sharp characters along with the most wicked humor imaginable. Don't miss Strip Tease, Hiaasen's crazed romp through lust, murder, and government machinations.
