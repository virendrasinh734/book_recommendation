Though celebrated in Irish society for her extraordinary beauty, Elizabeth Gunning is just playing a part. The supposed daughter of Viscount Mayo is in fact a common woman of uncommon appearance. And if her domineering mother has her say, Elizabeth is going to keep up the charade and take London society by storm. With her golden hair and violet eyes, Elizabeth has men falling at her feet, but only one has captured her heart: John Campbell, the rakishly handsome Duke of Argyll. If she surrenders to his smoldering gaze and heated touch, sheâ€™ll be playing with fire. Because only John knows her deepest secret, and knows just how to unleash the passion within her.
