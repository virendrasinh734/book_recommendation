#1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • From the beloved author of the Vampire Chronicles, the third installation of her spellbinding Mayfair Chronicles—the inspiration for the hit television series! “[Taltos] is a curious amalgam of gothic, glamour fiction, alternate history, and high soap opera.”—The Washington Post Book World When Ashlar learns that another Taltos has been seen, he is suddenly propelled into the haunting world of the Mayfair family, the New Orleans dynasty of witches forever besieged by ghosts, spirits, and their own dizzying powers. For Ashlar knows this powerful clan is intimately linked to the heritage of the Taltos. In a swirling universe filled with death and life, corruption and innocence, this mesmerizing novel takes us on a wondrous journey back through the centuries to a civilization half-human, of wholly mysterious origin, at odds with mortality and immortality, justice and guilt. It is an enchanted, hypnotic world that could only come from the imagination of Anne Rice. . . . The magic of the Mayfairs continues: THE WITCHING HOUR • LASHER • TALTOS
