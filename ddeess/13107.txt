Way of the Peaceful Warrior's enduring appeal has as much to do with the author's compelling personal story as with his message. Dan Millman's journey began during a period of spiritual crisis when he met a powerful old warrior named Socrates at a gas station at 3 a.m., and found himself tempted by an elusive woman named Joy. Thus began an odyssey that led him to the concept of the "peaceful warrior" - and on toward a final confrontation that would either deliver or destroy him. His discovery that the life and practice of the peaceful warrior is action helped him make sense of his life and find a sense of purpose, which he was able to impart to others. For the peaceful warrior, the messages are simple but resonant: "What you give, you receive. Doing is understanding. And you can do anything when you find the heart and courage for it."
