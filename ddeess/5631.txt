Ever since legwarmers were cool, best friends Tara, Katherine, and Fintan have survived small-town ennui, big-city heartbreak, and endless giddy nights out on the town. But now that they've graduated to their slightly more serious thirties, only Fintan has what can honestly be called a "love life." With Tara struggling daily with her eternal diet—and her dreadful, penny-pinching boyfriend—and Katherine keeping her single existence as organized as her drawer full of matching bra and panty sets, it seems they'll never locate the exit door out of the "last chance saloon." But it's always when you are least ready for change that fate insists on one. And when catastrophe inevitably follows crisis, the lives of three best friends are sure to change in unexpected ways ... and not necessarily for the worse. You devoured the hilarious antics of Claire in Watermelon. You laughed 'til you cried in Lucy Sullivan Is Getting Married. You took a vacation gone mad in Rachel's Holiday. You flew away with Margaret—good girl gone bad—in Angels. You got a peek inside the cutthroat world of women's fashion magazines in Sushi for Beginners. Now, raise your glass to Tara, Katherine, and Fintan in Last Chance Saloon.
