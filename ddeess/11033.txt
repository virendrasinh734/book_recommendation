Whether writing about relationships, sexy little girls, loving and bickering couples, angry suburbanites, frustrated job-seekers, or Jewish children performing a Christmas play, Grace Paley captures the loneliness, poignancy, and humor of the human experience with matchless style in this book of short stories. "Fresh and vigorous...Mrs. Paley’s view of life is her own."--The New Yorker "The glad tidings from this reviewer’s corner are of the appearance of a [writer] possessed of an all-too-infrequent literary virtue--the comic vision."--The New York Times
