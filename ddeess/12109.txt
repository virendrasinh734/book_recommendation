"In the haunting prologue, an Indian sachem vanquishes a sorcerer's evil spirit by ritualistically planting a cedar sapling over the grave where he was buried alive. Centuries later, the tree falls to man's hungry saws, and the Caliban is out of the bag. Stokes's voice takes on a hypnotic hush for the Indian legends".--The New York Times Book Review.
