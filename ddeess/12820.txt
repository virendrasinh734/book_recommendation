Uncle John's All-Purpose Extra Strength Bathroom Reader, is filled to the rim with 504 all-new pages of some of the most interesting bathroom reading we've ever found. "All-Purpose means that you can read your Bathroom Reader anywhere, in the obvious spot, in bed or, heck, by the pool or at work," says Uncle John. "And what gives it Extra Strength? Years of research gathered, you can guess where, by our crackpot, I mean hotshot, team." It's our 13th edition, and to celebrate our luck, we have a page devoted to triskaidekaphobia, the fear of ten plus three. You'll learn why the number thirteen got such a bad rap. We thoroughly investigate the history of Dracula, the stories behind the biggest movie bombs ever, and the origin and unintended use of the I.Q. test. Plus court transquips, word origins, jokes, brain teasers, Uncle John's Stall of Fame, and more!
