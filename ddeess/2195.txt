Cleverly crafted to take place in a span of 24 hours, Michael Prescott's "Comes the Dark" presents one woman's hunt for an elusive killer. A killer whose method invokes a childhood memory...a haunted past...a recurring nightmare! And as dusk falls, she will come to fear the night...and come to dread the truth behind the relentless stalker. This fast-paced psychological thrill-ride, like the novels of New York Times bestselling authors James Patterson, John Sanford, and Jeffery Deaver, creates an atmosphere of mounting terror and undeniable horror!
