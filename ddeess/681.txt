News of Louise's death startles Addy out of the trance that has become her adult life. She flies to the Caribbean for the funeral, and amid the chaos and grief of Louise's family, Addy confronts the myths that helped her survive her childhood - the same ones that have made her adult life a barren ground. Celebrating Louise's life, she arrives at a new hope for her own.
