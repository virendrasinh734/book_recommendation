The Japanese believe that until the age of three children, whether Japanese or not, are gods, each one an okosama, or "lord child." On their third birthday they fall from grace and join the rest of the human race. In Am√©lie Nothomb's new novel The Character of Rain, we learn that divinity is a difficult thing from which to recover.
