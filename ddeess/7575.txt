When shards of glass are found in a jar of baby food and bottles of ginger ale are poisoned with bleach at the local supermarket, the results are fatal. DCI Jin Ashworth and his sergeant, Holly Bedford have little to go on. Local councilor Emma Cowper complicates matters by involving herself in the investigation, hoping to use the crisis as a vote-winner. But the most mysterious feature of the case seems to be the relatively small sum demanded by the 'organization' responsible for the death. Why are they only asking for Â£40,000 from the Save-U-Supermarket? And why have they threatened the personal safety of the beautiful Holly Bedford should the police become involved?
