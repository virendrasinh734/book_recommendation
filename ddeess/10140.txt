A promising young tennis player with an overly demanding father, Donna DiTullio is hospitalized with suicidal manic -depression. Within weeks of admittance, she feels better due to an experimental drug called Capricet. Then, Donna plunges from the hospital balcony, leaving herself comatose and paralyzed. Enter Dan Sheridan, a sharp-edged Boston attorney called in to sue the hospital. As Dan goes up against Boston's two most powerful institutions--the medical establishment and the Church--he finds himself embroiled in a case that will challenge his belief in the law, his personal code of ethics, and may even cost him his life.
