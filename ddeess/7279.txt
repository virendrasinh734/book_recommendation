One day in the desert, Veronica Smiles, a professional explorer, meets God. Apparently she'd called out to Him (at least, that's His story, she hadn't considered Him in years). A relationship reluctantly emerges, however, and as it develops Veronica finds herself enjoying some extremely uncharacteristic situations. Humour and grief are boldly combined in this extraordinary novel.
