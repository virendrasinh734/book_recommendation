#1 New York Times bestselling author Nora Roberts presents four romantic stories of impossible dreams come true... In Nora Roberts’s “In Dreams,” a beautiful young woman is drawn to a castle in the forests of Ireland and becomes the link to a stranger’s past—and the curse that has trapped him forever in the eternity of his own dreams. In Jill Gregory’s “The Sorcerer’s Daughter,” the fate of a captive wizard depends on his lovely daughter—and the intentions of a spellcast adventurer who dreams of a priceless treasure, and a love that could be the greatest reward of all. In Ruth Ryan Langan’s “The Enchantment,” two strangers seek refuge in an abandoned estate on a storm-swept night—only to discover that their most elusive dreams of romance are as enchanted, and as real, as true love itself. In Marianne Willman’s “The Bridge of Sighs,” an American art appraiser becomes haunted by dreams of a lonely young girl while visiting Venice—a vision that illuminates a tragic past, and a future of endless love.
