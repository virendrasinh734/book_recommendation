New York Times bestselling author Jane Feather has won legions of fans and critical accolades for her sweeping romances portraying a unique blend of sizzling seduction and dangerous intrigue. In this first of two romances featuring two unconventional sisters whose quest to solve the mystery surrounding their lives puts each of them in the path of a dangerously irresistible hero, Jane Feather tells the story of a daring young widow and a master spy engaged in a duel of wits--and seduction--to uncover a dark secret.... To Kiss a Spy Lady Pen Bryantson had been caught red-handed looking for clues among her mother-in-law’s papers. But the mystery she sought to uncover only deepened with the sudden appearance of a man whose mere presence sent shivers of excitement coursing through her. What could this dangerously seductive man who moved with a courtier’s charm and brandished an assassin’s skill want with someone as ordinary as she was? But to Owen D’Arcy, the bewitching young woman he’d been assigned to ensnare was anything but ordinary. With a single kiss, the sophisticated spy found that he’d been unexpectedly disarmed. Determined to seduce her on his own terms, Owen offered Pen a devil’s bargain she had no choice but to accept. Now they would both go undercover, only to find themselves drawn into a world of deception and double cross, where anyone could be the deadliest of enemies--and their own uncontrolled passion the most dangerous threat of all.
