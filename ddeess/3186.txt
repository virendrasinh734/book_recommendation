This book is your traveling pleasure companion. I want to remind you to seek out pleasure and lightly scoop it up! It is also a guide to finding pleasure in all of the difficult places: during illness, at the periodontist, facing our aging and mortality... I share my explorations into pleasure, and the places I get lost. Let's magnify our pleasures together, no matter what else is happening in our lives.
