The old mill has been silent for a hundred years, its dread secrets locked from view. Still, the people of Westover, Massachusetts, remember . . . and whisper of that terrible day when horrifying flames claimed eleven innocent young lives. The day the mill's doors slammed shut--forever. But now, the last of the once-powerful Sturgess family is about to unlock those doors again . . . and unleash an elemental fury. For behind the padlocks, deep within the dark, abandoned building, a terrible vengeance waits. A vengeance conceived in HELLFIRE.
