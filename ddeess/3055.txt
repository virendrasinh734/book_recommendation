Will truth and virtue triumph over the deadly darkness of an all-consuming evil? The war against the dragon minions of Queen Takhisis rages on. Armed with the mysterious, magical Dragon Orbs and the shining, silver Dragonlance, the Companions of the Lance lead their people in a desperate final battle. Knight and barbarian, warrior and mage, dwarf and kenderâ€”no one has reckoned how high the price of defeat, or even victory, might be. But now, in the dawn of a new day, the dark secrets that have long shadowed the hearts of the Companions come to light. If they are to truly defeat the five-headed dragon goddess, they must find a way to overcome their own personal conflicts and doubts. From betrayal and treachery to fragility and weakness, the greatest battle now lies within each of them. Dragons of Spring Dawning is the third book in the Dragonlance Chronicles.
