IN THE LAND OF PENDARAN, LIVELY, AFFECTIONATE Shelby Parker was born to a simple life -- yet her mother, Daria, and those around her cannot help but notice the graces she possesses. Among those taking note of Shelby's winsome ways and tender heart are the king and queen of the House of Markham, who are seeking a new wife for their widowed son, Prince Nikolai. To uphold a long-cherished tradition of their country, Shelby and Nikolai agree to an arranged marriage. But while Nikolai is a perfect gentleman at public functions, he remains distant and shy at home, leaving Shelby to ponder the inner workings of his heart. Will the prince ever love her as he did his first wife? Can the faith they share overcome the barriers between them? A contemporary story of honor and commitment freely given and richly rewarded
