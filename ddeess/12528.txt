Mr. Bones, the canine hero of Auster's remarkable new novel, is the sidekick and confidant of Willy G. Christmas, the brilliant, troubled, and altogether original poet-saint from Brooklyn. Like Don Quixote and Sancho Panza, they sally forth on a last great adventure in search of Willy's high school teacher and mentor.
