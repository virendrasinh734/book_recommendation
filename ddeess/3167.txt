The long-awaited new novel by the award-winning, bestselling author of Startide Rising and The Uplift War--an epic novel set fifty years from tomorrow, a carefully-reasoned, scientifically faithful tale of the fate of our world. One hell of a novel . . . has what sci-fi readers want these days; intelligence, action, and an epic scale.--Isaac Asimov's Science Fiction Magazine. Line drawings.
