With the fast-paced excitement and glamour that have made each of her books a major international bestseller, Jackie Collins now turns from the husbands and wives of Beverly Hills to the glittering world of big-time music-- the world of sex, drugs and rock and roll, in which hopes and dreams are as important as drop-dead ambition, ruthless power, and big money... "Rock Star" begins with an exclusive, expensive fund-raiser for Governor Jack Highland on the magnificent estate of the ruthlessly powerful and universally feared record magnate Marcus Citroen, and his icy wife, Nova, bringing together three of the biggest recording stars in the world: The Legend-- Kris Phoenix-- a brash, sexy English singer and legendary guitarist... The Survivor-- Bobby Mondella-- a handsome, black soul superstar, still recovering from a near-fatal accident... The Newcomer-- Raffealla-- an exotically beautiful girl of mixed race and wealthy parentage, who has every reason to sing the blues... The three of them attend the event reluctantly. Marcus Citroen has called in favors, and the time has come to pay. "Rock Star" is the story of their rise to fame and glory, of their triumphs and pains, their loves and their hates, their feuds and fights, interweaving their lives until the fateful night in Malibu, on Marcus Citroen's lush, ocean-front estate, where they finally meet their destiny... For this night of fabulous power and wealth has also attracted the attention of Maxwell Sicily, son of mob boss Carmen Sicily-- and Maxwell, masquerading as a waiter, intends to pull off the crime of his life...
