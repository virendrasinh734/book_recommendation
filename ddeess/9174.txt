The first book in the Dragon Star trilogy returns to the spellbinding fantasy world of the bestselling Dragon Prince trilogy With her widely acclaimed, bestselling fantasy trilogy, Dragon Prince, Melanie Rawn opened an enchanted gateway to a spellbinding universe of Sunrunner’s magic and sorcerous evil, of a ruler fighting to bring peace to a world of warring kingdoms, and of the dragons—deadly dangerous yet holding the secret to wealth beyond imagining.

For Andry it signals the start of a nightmare made real, the horrifying fulfillment of his long ago visions of his homeland in flames, and he will draw upon even the forbidden sorcerer’s magic in an attempt to destroy this enemy which is bent on the extermination of all Sunrunners.
