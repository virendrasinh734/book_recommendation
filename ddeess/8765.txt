Slow Hand: Women Writing Erotica is an anthology of stories in which women artfully explore their own erotic terrain. To create this newest of her popular anthologies, Michele Slung challenged women--straight and gay, old and young, journalists, poets, academics, women whose job descriptions range from "anthropologist" to "performance artist", as well as professional novelists and short story writers--to turn her on. And from across the United States, Canada, and Great Britain, a variety of daring and talented women, hearing that she was putting together a book to reflect their most intimate sexual selves, enthusiastically responded. Michele Slung has collected the best of these pieces in Slow Hand, offering page after page of tantalizing sensual adventure for our reading--and feeling--pleasure. But whether the stories stay as close to home as a familiar partner's embrace or whether they move into the darker recesses of extraordinary desires and even more extraordinary experiences, the special quality shared by these tales is their ability to seduce us. So while the mood of this collection is indeed slow (in all the right ways), it's certain that your pulse will quicken.
